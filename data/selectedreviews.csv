Bonus-We had a great parking space and didn't have to park far at all!!

Came here for my husband's birthday. We were quoted 25-30 minutes but didn't wait long at all. Maybe 15 minutes. They have a good mix of specialty drinks. I wanted to get a milkshake but was too full to get it. 

We got the crab dip. I saw it was highly recommended on YELP and was very pleased. It's a very large portion. We could barely finish it. The dip was creamy with large chunks of crab in it. Chips were large and crispy. That sauce that's on it really made it delicious. Everything mixed together was just amazing!! 

I got the shrimp tempura roll. I was surprised at how big it was. It was awesome, especially with the siracha sauce. I also got the Taste Explosion roll. It was my first roll like that. It was flat with ground beef, jalepenos, onions, some type of amazing sauce with a tomato and cilantro sauce on it with cheese. It was wrapped with seaweed and rice. It was delicious!! It was large and very filling. Ground beef was amazing. 

My husband got the firecracker roll. He said it was one of the best sushi rolls he's ever had. He also said he can tell the ingredients were really good quality and very fresh. 

I secretly told our server, Bryan that it was my husband's birthday and he made it so special. They came out and sang to him and gave us a birthday cake! The cake was huge! Chocolate layers with an awesome layer up top. Bryan was such a great server. He was very helpful and was super attentive. Highly recommended!!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2016-03-30,1,review,1

As someone mentioned the menu is kind of outrageously large and that usually means lesser quality and a slower kitchen. I appreciate a restaurant that does a small menu phenomenally.

It took about 15 minutes (3 stops by the waitress) and finally her recommendation before I placed my order. I ordered the original cowfish bento box with a Philly roll, slider, sweet potato fries, edamame, and cucumber salad. The sweet potato fries were delicious and the cucumber salad is literally (the original definition, not the new ridiculous one) the best I've had at any sushi bar. Everything else was pretty basic and the service was pretty slow. They messed up my sister's order. My friend and I were nearly done eating by the time she got her meal. The manager brought it out and comp'ed it.

We ordered dessert too! A tower of lemon pound cake, ice cream, whipped cream, and berries. It was amazing. The three of us couldn't finish it! After dessert we waited for our check. We were chatting, but after 30 minutes or more we had to ASK for our check. The atmosphere was nice and maybe I'll try going at a less busy time before I make a final ruling on the service.

We were a bit envious of the table next to us though, as their server was very knowledgeable and explained most of the menu to them. We leaned in and listened to what their server was recommending! 
We started with the Lobster and crab spring rolls. They were excellent! I love the cilantro pesto and the Thai chili sauce that came with it!
My companion ordered the Cowfish Original Burger with a whole wheat bun. Which also gave the option to build your own! There are so many substitutions/ additions to choose from to personalize your burger! The options were limitless! He also got the crispy onion strings as his side dish. They were thinly breaded and crispy, very nice! But too much to finish! They left off the Cowfish sauce and grilled onions, so he was a bit disappointed about that! But still was a pretty good burger. 
I ordered a ""burgushi"" which was called The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi BuffalOOOOO-shi Roll! haha! This roll included sautéed chipotle bison, fried green tomato, grilled onions and feta cheese rolled inside, then coated with crispy tempura flakes. The roll is topped with fresh green tomato, chipotle aioli, diced tomato and red onion, and thinly sliced jalapeño pepper. It was very different and excellent! I really loved the it!

2195055,2,imGQirCh-t_Kftb4U7VuUA,6BrYfwcl8PUvzj3slwWyGw,"All right, let's get some things straight from an unbiased point-of-view:  this is not a real sushi restaurant, this cannot be the best restaurant in Charlotte, and there is nothing healthy on the menu.  It is a concept restaurant teetering on the edge of being a theme restaurant, the menu is incredibly overwhelming, and the food is heavy handed.  

All that aside, there are great items on the menu, but it needs to be thinned out a little bit.  This would have been two-stars if it weren't for the fantastic bar setup and one of the best milkshakes I've ever had (rice krispy concoction).  

I really wanted to try the ""amazing"" sushi, and I had very high expectations.  I ordered the Motherload, which offers no place for bad sushi to hide.  The roll was way too thick, loaded with cream cheese, and only tasted like the sauces and cream cheese.  I want to taste the raw fish.  The sashimi was also cut thick, which works fine for scallops and some fish varieties, but not for octopus, eel, or shrimp.  I did love the sauce with the summer roll, and the ""no rice"" option worked well to remove some of the weight.

The wine list is well thought out, and surprisingly well-priced, and the touch-big screen games built into the bar are absolutely genius (frog game conquered)!  I struggled not to order burgushi, but after seeing all the massive piles of sushi covered in red meat walk past, the guilt of my decision faded.  I once had a surf and turf roll at Wolfgang Puck's in Orlando that was perfectly poached lobster with thinly sliced, rare fillet on top w/ seaweed and ginger/siracha sauce that was perfection.  Sushi should be light, flavorful, and artistic....Cowfish is miles from that.

I've got to add that the two ""classy"" girls sitting next to me at the bar made an episode of Girls sound tame...and no, the two guys next to me were unfortunately not gay.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2013-01-16,2,review,0

Best restaurant discovery in Charlotte for years. I live sushi and I love burgers, never thought to eat them together but I am really happy Cowfish did!!

They nail the burgers, we had a variety of them at our table from made to order to some of the suggested combos on the menu.

Chipotle Bison and Lamb are incredible, perfectly cooked. Love that you can sub for these or turkey for any of their burgers. The build your own selections are numerous and super duper delicious.

I got a chipotle bison burger on a brioche bun with a coconut onion ring, sautéed mushrooms, truffle cheese, with a side of the codfish sauce, it was mouthwatering.

We also tried their novel concept of burgushi, which is burger associated foods incorporated with traditional sushi ingriedients.  We tried the taste of evolution roll subbing the beef for ground lamb and it blew the whole table away with how tasty it was.

We also tried one of their Asian Fusion rolls that included crab cakes and was baked at the end before serving, it was just as good.

Finally a place that marriesmy two favorite foods!

Oh yes, always ask for what their featured brews are, we had a local Foothills Heffeweisen (sp?) which was the perfect summer beer.

And have to give major props for our waiter Dennis for guiding us through the menu, being patient with our large party, surprising my aunt with an awesome birthday dessert, and looking out for the youngest at the table, my 7 month old baby.  Ask for Dennis when you go in.

Also Megan and Rachel the hostesses were also super nice pans helpful in getting us seated as soon as possible considering how busy they were!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2012-06-13,0,review,1

I had twice attempted to eat here on weekends during the holiday season (which was a big mistake) and was greeted with the news that there would be at least a 45 minute wait for lunch. On my third attempt, I went in March 2014 on a Friday afternoon around 2:00 and there was still at least a 20 minute wait. I chose to wait since I was a meeting a friend and had already completed my errands in the mall.

As you wait, you can watch your name inch up to the top of the list on a large projection screen that's supposed to simulate a fish tank and you also get sent a text.

I ordered the neon dion roll and was very happy with the flavors and taste. My friend ordered the bento box that included a slider (of her choice), sushi roll, cucumber salad, and other sides.

The appetizer was nice and fresh (I eat a lot of sushi so I would know). And I like how it came out on a leaf, with ice underneath it, to keep the sushi cool. The burger came next and that was mouth-watering. Fries were decent, and their fried pickles are excellent (try them if you haven't before!). The dessert... oh man, was this good or what. The chocolate mousse cake I believe.. was spectacular.

The restaurant is located right outside the mall in a little strip of businesses. A few parking spots are available in front of the restaurant.

Based on the pictures from other reviewers, I decided to go for The Taste Explosion burgushi. For those that are unfamiliar with burgushi, it is a sushi roll with burger ingredients inside.

First bite impression: burgushi is really good! You kinda have to get past the idea that you're eating a slider in the form of sushi though. A couple bites later, I thought to myself ""meh.""

As for the food, the burgers are unique, I think the actual burgers are ok but the flavors they add are what makes them. Their truffle fries are amazing and highly recommend. The onion rings are also good but different, they have a little sweetness due to the coconut they use in the batter. I normally don't like coconut but these were really good.

My favorite item are the spiked shakes, love them! Highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2015-01-09,0,review,0

It is very popular so expect it to be loud and there will most likely be a wait. We were seated on the heated patio which was quieter than the dinning room so we were happy to sit there. The server was really nice. We started with the tuna nachos. They were delicious. Instead of chips they served them on top of fried wontons. The cab Rangoon base was tasty. The tuna was fresh and served rare. I tried their regular bento box since it was my first time eating here. The burger was a nice medium rare and really tasty. I had the Philly roll was delicious. The salmon was fresh and the rice was well seasoned. They are very generous with the sides in the bento box. I changed my fries to seaweed salad. It was only a 50 cent upgrade for a huge portion of salad. The seaweed salad was not overwhelmed by sesame oil. The Thai cucumber salad was sweet, spicy, and very delicious. The edamame were good and plentiful. For dessert we tried the chocolate mouse brownie. I was most disappointed with that. It was by no means bad but it was not like it was described. It tasted like chocolate cake with mouse and whipped cream on it. I would order a different dessert next time. overall it was 5 star food and service and I would come back again.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2014-11-29,0,review,1

The food was pretty good all the way around. I didn't want to come here and not try sushi and a burger so that's what I had. I had the philly roll sushi and the jalapeño popper show stopper burger. I was a little worried the jalapeño burger may be a bit over powering but it wasn't. The flavors all worked nicely together. My wife had the veggie burger and it looked solid as well. Nice homemade patty but she said it lacked flavor (still very good though).

C ordered the Chinese chicken salad, and while it was very good, a few of the ingredients were not the freshest.  She enjoyed it, and would get it again.

I should know better than to have sushi anywhere but an authentic Japanese restaurant, as this was very disappointing.  As soon as I saw the rice in the yellowtail hosomaki, I could tell it was not made properly.  Overcooked (with a mushy texture) is not how it is supposed to be done.  Though it may take five years to learn how to make perfect sushi rice, I have to think a restaurant of this caliber could produce something better than what I was served.  The yellowtail was just fair.  The spicy tuna hand roll was probably the weakest one I've ever had(!)  Large, clumsy chunks of grade B tuna, a bland sauce and limp cucumber strips.....I don't think so.

This place, apparently, is almost always busy.  We came here on a Sunday afternoon at like 3:30, and we still had to wait 25 minutes for a table.  Apparently lunch doesn't end until 4:00, which we didn't know, but we got seated just in time to get served ""lunch"" (which was a total hurray moment for us).

Once we got seated, everything was smooth sailing.  Well, sort of.  The biggest problem was narrowing down the plentiful menu to decide what we wanted.  We finally decided to order the coconut battered onion rings.  I have to say, these were pretty darn tasty, and the sweet chili sauce with it was pretty yummy as well (my partner says the same thing about the wasabi aioli, but I'm not a horseradish person).  Unfortunately, these would have been better had we gotten them as an actual appetizer, but the kitchen was backed up and we didn't get them until after we'd gotten our entrees.  Still, they were delish.

We decided we both wanted burgers and sushi, but we couldn't decide if we wanted one of their lunch bentos.  We decided to get a sushi combo and burger separately, and then we split them.  We decided to get the Arnold Hamandegger, which was pretty good.  The meat in the burger was very moist and flavorful, but the overall burger was not as impressive as the patty itself.  We also decided to get the Spicy Crunchy Roll combo, which was pretty good as well (although not very spicy).  I decided to add some sriracha to the rolls, and they were really good.  The fish in the roll was awesome, but again, the overall roll was not as impressive.

Their sides are superbly delicious.  I had the sweet and spicy Thai cucumbers, which were very delicious and just the right level of spiciness.  I also had the edamame, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned to bring out their awesome buttery flavor.  

Additionally, they offer some really wonderful sounding drinks and dessert, but we did not get any.  Next trip I will definitely have to try some of that.

Service was pretty good, with the exception of getting our appetizer late.  Our server was attentive and nice, so I can't complain (it wasn't her fault anyway).  They do have a pretty big waiting area, and you can also sit around the bar.   Parking does not seem like a problem; while you can't always find a spot in that plaza, there is plenty of mall parking very close, so you don't have to walk too far.  The decor is bright and fun, but it tends to be very loud in there.  I could barely near my partner talking, and he sat right in front of me at the table.

As far as prices go, they are a little pricey, but you also get quality food for your money.  You can expect to pay about $10-15 per person at lunch time, and more like $15-25 per person at dinner time, depending on what you order (not including drinks or dessert).

If you come here before dinner time, you can make a reservation, in case you don't want to wait.  They take reservations every day from 11-6, which seems pretty helpful if you like to eat early, but you still have long waits if you want to eat at a later time.

All in all, this place has good ingredients, good food, and good service.  However, expect it will probably be busy and loud, even if you go at an ""off"" time.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2012-08-10,0,review,0

The manager took the roll off of the check, which I appreciated it, yes you cannot make every one happy, but I expected a lot more than squished rice on a rolls. I am very picky on how the rolls are made, and how much of a pressure is being applied when you roll the rolls. (No pun intended)

The execution is mostly okay.  The decor is a little over the top for me, but good for kids.  When we went recently for lunch on a weekday, I could not believe how many kids were there.  That's not a bad thing; I have nothing against kids.  But the fact that there were whole families eating that day exacerbated the well-documented line problem at this place.

I was expecting lackluster food, but it was actually very nicely done.  I got one of their burger/sushi combo boxes.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  No real standout items, but a very solid meal.

I almost want to take a star off for the waiting in line, but I guess it would be unfair to penalize cowfish for its popularity.

Their menu is ridiculously huge (and not just in physical size).  There are so many things to choose from-- Sushi- check! Burgers- check! Burger sushi rolls-- check! Sushi burgers- check!  You'll need about ten minutes to read through the menu and ten more to try and figure out why ""burgushi"" sounds so good. I ended up ordering/splitting a few of their fusion sushi (""burgushi"") rolls and a few more traditional rolls. The rolls are pretty big and I was quickly full. 

The restaurant started to slow down around 9:00pm (not as many families hanging out) and the bartender was able to slow down as well and chat and make suggestions of things to do and see in the area. As well as talk about his favorites on the menu.

Cons:
The cons of this place don't have anything to do with how the restaurant operations, so I can't take away stars for that. However, the place is big, and it fills up quickly. As hinted to via Andrew H's review... the clientele are a bit lacking. It seems that this is more of a place to go and be seen, not a place to go and be social.

Very flavorful and somehow the beef (which was raw-similar to steak tar tar) seemed to melt.  The rolls were large and really worked well with wasabi and soy.  The server was very helpful.  My mother who only eats california rolls got the Boursin Bird which is a chicken sandwich with boursin cheese.  I tried that as well. Very good but the burgushi was where its at.  I would like to go back because the menu is so large (which is both positive and negative its a bit overwhelming.)

Our server, Brian was friendly and very helpful.  He recommended a nice chunky unfiltered sake that scratched my itch for the night.  

Felt like something unique, ordered the filet oscar roll from the burgushi menu.  This roll was great, except it was too dry.  The filet everything inside the roll was fine, it's that the crab cake on the top combined with the rice made it difficult to chew and swallow.

I have them another shot after they re-opened (for the second time) after their rhinovirus scare. It made sense that their lines would be shortest, and their kitchen would be cleanest, after their recent shutdown and extended cleanup.

That was correct, and no one in my party got sick. Indeed, Cowfish was about half full, and I was able to get in and seated immediately.

On my last visit, I was disappointed with some of the burgerushi, but was really impressed with some of the sushi. I was determined to stick with the sushi, which was fresh and delicious.

I'm not sure what my waiter's name was, but it should have been, ""10 minute minimum."" Because every single thing took at least 10 minutes. It was at least 10 minutes until someone came to my table. Again, the restaurant was hall full. 

I am unsure if I have ever had someone take my dinner order after my appetizer had arrived. I am certain that has never happened after the appetizer had arrived but drinks had not. At least, before my recent visit to Cowfish. Pretty certain Chilis can manage such basics, but somehow a place that goes $50/$60 a plate cannot.

I am done complaining about all the waiting I did during my 100 minute long dinner. How is the sushi?

The sashimi is my favorite in Charlotte. Their sashimi is easily the freshest, juiciest, tastiest I have had in this town. Nothing like a big bowl of their fresh fish on ice, especially when it is fantastic fish.

The rolls are good. I would not say better than a number of other sushi joints, but good. Inventive. A little weird (I think mine came with burger sauce or something I didn't try).

I really wish they had better service, because they could potentially be better than Baku, Pisces, Yama, or a number of other sushi restaurants.

The service was great and the food was great, so I had no reason to expect anything less than great service when I visited last weekend. I was VERY disappointed to say the least. I ordered the lobster and crab egg rolls to share with my girlfriend and we both ordered burgers. The appetizers came out quickly and they were delicious......but that is where the ""positive"" ends. When I ordered my burger, I asked to add pickles. When the burger came out, there were no pickles. I took 2 bites and noticed that my burger was a little ""cool"". I cut my burger in half and it was PINK and cool to the touch. The pink meat started to crumble and fall onto the plate when I touched it. The burger was cooked long enough to brown it on the outsides but the inside was RAW. My girlfriends burger was also under cooked but not as badly as mine was. We called the waiter over and showed him the burger and he mumbled ""it was supposed to be well done"". No apologies or anything. When the new burgers came out, mine still had no pickles, and it looked ""thrown together"" like someone was in a rush to get it out. My girlfriend ordered the Jalapeno popper burger which is supposed to have fried jalapenos on it but her new burger had no fried jalapenos but instead a huge pile of raw sliced jalapenos. We decided to order desserts and I saw that they had a tall cake dessert made with ""moist"" pound cake which sounded delicious and there was also a cheesecake dessert. So I ordered the the pound cake dessert and my girlfriend ordered the cheesecake. While we were ordering, the waiter told us that he thinks the milkshakes are a better dessert than the actual items listed on the dessert menu. We should have taken his advice and just ordered the milkshakes. The ""moist"" pound cake in my dessert were more like hockey pucks and my girlfriends cheesecake was just bland and tasteless. It didn't taste anything like cheesecake and was really disappointing. My girlfriend called the waiter over and asked him to take the desserts back. My waiter now had an attitude and did not say anything else to us. I guess we were supposed to eat raw burgers and disgusting desserts. Just don't send them back? He handed us the check moments later, returned my girlfriends credit card, and walked away from the table and never came back. No good night, No thank you for coming. 

One thing that I look forward to when dining out is ""CONSISTENCY"". I don't want to have terrible service one day, good service the next, and then have it be terrible again by the 3rd visit. Fortunately for my server, I am a good tipper so I left a $10 tip on a $40 tab for mediocre service and terrible food. Unfortunately I will never be back to this restaurant. There are plenty of great restaurants here in Charlotte where I can get great service and food on every visit. Too bad Cowfish is not one of them.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,2,2016-01-08,0,review,0
2195657,0,cQfcLsUFH-txdue1Z7mxbg,2eDTP1Uo2ZQvCw4B0EJfFA,"The name is interesting in itself ""Cowfish,"" as it hints that it serves both steak and seafood.

I was in Charlotte for business and my BF and I wanted to come here as it is the most reviewed restaurant in the city.  We specifically went for sushi, although they have tons of menu items to choose from.  

The restaurant is very large with a full bar.  It's located next door to a mall and right off a busy street.  We dined on a Monday evening and was overwhelmed with the menu.  This place has everything from burgers to steaks to sandwiches to sushi, including their infamous ""BurgSushi"" creations which fuses burgers and sushi together.  They have sushi with burger meat inside, and they'll make a burger out of sushi ingredients.  However you can imagine to mix burgers and sushi, this place managed to do it.

We started off with an enormous serving of calamari which was pretty average.  The sweet chilli sauce was not a great dip to go with the calamari.  If the restaurant could get their hands on a chipotle aioli sauce, it would be game over.  

I ordered the recommended Taste Explosion ($15) which is one of their BurgSushi items, made up of Angus ground beef, applewood bacon, jalapeños, spicy mayo inside, coated with tempura flakes. Topped with tomato and cheese, and drizzled with pesto.  It truly was a taste explosion. Something very different and unique, and delicious at the same time.

My boyfriend got a couple of ""normal"" sushi rolls which were also delicious.  I sipped on a China Blossom martini which was also delightful with the meal.

This was a wonderful place to grab dinner no matter what you're craving.  This is the perfect place for a group of people that have a wide range of palettes.  Unlike most sushi restaurants, if you don't like sushi, you're not just confined to a bento box which is great.

This concept seems a little confused at first glance but turns out to be pretty darned ingenious!  Cowfish gets 4.5 stars (I'm rounding down because my order on my first visit was disappointing) for delicious food, generous portions, limitless variety, great ambiance and excellent service.  I have been twice in one week since discovering it. 

TIP: They're located on The Residences side of Southpark Mall so park in the adjacent parking structure for ease; trying to hunt down a spot right in the front of the restaurant is a futile exercise.

Fun ambiance, family-friendly.  Dining inside the restaurant, you have a selection of high tops or semi-booths and a view of the saltwater aquarium; otherwise, you can sit on their patio, which is sprinkled with strategically placed fans and heaters.  Just off the patio is a large fountain and relatively large lawn where I have seen kids sprawled about.  We have opted for the patio both times that we came; it's a serene way to enjoy an outdoor meal.

Excellent service.  We have been on a late Saturday afternoon when they were relatively busy and a Sunday afternoon, when it was pretty quiet.  Albeit, the Sunday service was much more attentive, but it could be a result of a different server.  The first time we came, our server was good but not memorable.  However, on our second visit, Shelley really went above and beyond to ensure that we had everything that we needed and that our dining experience was delightful.  We ended up ordering more than we could eat in one sitting and she painstakingly made sure that each sauce that accompanied our meal was packed accordingly.

Limitless variety.  Their menu is expansive (it's literally several pages long; not quite as long as Cheesecake Factory but it's in that league) but the great thing is that everything is fully customizable; it's always disappointing when you see ""no modifications or no substitutions"" on a menu so kudos to them for encouraging you to ask for exactly what you want, how you want it.  

Delicious food.  Their portions are very generous so for those of you who, like me, have bigger eyes than your stomachs, take heed.  It's not necessarily that the food is innovative or complex, it's more that the food is very flavorful and well prepared.  Note that they do use imitation crab. I've had:

________________DELICIOUS:
+++  rock shrimp.  The shrimp is perfectly crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside.  The very creamy sauce has just the right balance of spiciness and sweetness.  It's served on a bed of lettuce, cabbages and cucumbers.
+++  seared sesame tuna.  The tuna is extremely fresh with no fishiness to it whatsoever.  It is served on a bed of seaweed salad and cucumbers, which is sprinkled with a ginger citrus sauce that is seriously divine.  I brought this home; it was still delicious the next day.
+++  minis of the week.  We added cheese and pickles to ours.  The angus beef is juicy, even in this compact size.  But the Cowfish sauce is what makes this amazing.  It's reminiscent of Thousand Island but is much thicker and sweeter.  I thought this was delicious and I don't really care for burgers much.
+++  beef bare burger.  This burger was outstanding.  The juiciness of the beef, the Cowfish sauce, it was just a stellar burger.  Did I mention that I don't like burgers??  The fries were also flavorful and yummy.
+++  Mark's roll.  This roll has tuna, jalapeño, cream cheese, Kano, scallions and is flash fried.  It is topped with mayo and sriracha but a little bit of masago; a great crunch roll and not spicy at all.  The ponzu dipping sauce was absolutely fantastic.
_______________GOOD:
+++  yellowtail.  My BF is obsessed with Zuma, his all-time favorite restaurant chain and their yellowtail is one of the things he craves.  He's always on the hunt for a second runner up.  The jalapeño and ponzu sauce are reminiscent but the cut of the yellowtail is too thick (they give you probably 3-4 times more than Zuma does) but I recommended that next time, he ask for tempura flakes or onion rings to add the Zuma crunch factor.  In not comparing it to anything, I thought it was great.
+++  tropical storm roll.  This roll is kind of a rainbow roll (CA, with fish on top), sprinkled with eel sauce but the thick yuzu dipping sauce just takes it to the next level.
_______________SKIP:
+++  lobster and crab spring rolls.  The spring roll is a misnomer because it's fried and there is just way too much flakey egg roll on the outside.  If they reinvented this in traditional non-fried rice paper, this may be a winner.
+++  Dion's OMG roll.  More like OMG I shouldn't have ordered a roll with coconut in it.

They had burgers and sushi, both of which I love on their own... but fusing them together to make burgushi?! What an unexpectedly delicious and unique concept.

To start, we had Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos which were wonton chips with a dollop of the house-made crab rangoon dip accompanied by pico de gallo and avocado topped with a slice of blackened ahi tuna seared rare and mixed greens. Fresh and delicious. I ordered the Mediterranean Lamb Burger for my entree. I've had many Mediterranean inspired burgers all over and this one had to be the best. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flash fried wedge of feta cheese on the burger was a nice touch.

And, frankly, the burger side of the house is superb. There are several preconfigured selections available with a wide array of toppings and add on items. There is also a build your own burger with an almost dizzying array of choices for buns, meats, cheeses and additional toppings. Personally, I like a half pound burger on their brioche bun with apple smoked bacon, pepper jack cheese and lots of their cowfish sauce. Other choices for meats include turkey, bison and veggie. And what would a good burger be with out fries? Which are always cooked to near perfection. 

The wait staff is uniformly excellent. Pleasant, knowledgeable and attentive. To date, after several visits to this establishment, I have yet to experience even an unpleasant moment.

My mother is visiting from out of town and, as a single mother, was obligated to bring my five-month-old son.  Before making the choice to dine at The Cowfish, I looked up their website and read the ""About"" section to make sure this was, indeed, a family friendly restaurant.  The Cowfish website claims they are ""a fun-loving environment that anyone can enjoy "" and customers are encouraged to ""bring the entire family for a meal "".  However, upon arriving at the restaurant, it was glaringly obvious that our patronage was not wanted.  

We were told there would be a 10-20 minute wait--which was completely acceptable for a Saturday evening--however, as we sat on the bench outside the restaurant, we watched at least 5 other parties of 2 be seated as soon as they walked through the door.  After about 30 minutes, I asked the hostess how much longer the wait would be. She promised we were the next party on the list and that they were cleaning our table.  Ten minutes minutes passed by (along with two other parties) and we decided to go elsewhere.  

I understand that children are not always welcomed in certain restaurants.  Out of respect for those businesses and the adults who choose to dine in such establishments, I purposefully choose places to eat that will accommodate young kids.  Imagine my disappointment when I found out the hard way that The Cowfish is, in fact, not a family friendly place and that they do not welcome people from ""all walks of life"".  At least they live up to the promise of making an experience at their restaurant a ""memorable experience"".

I hope this restaurant adjusts its website to reflect the atmosphere and clientele it wishes to serve--or that they adjust their attitude.  I've never been treated so poorly by a wait staff!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,1,2012-09-02,0,review,0

I recommend the tuna martini and any of their special rolls. My husband got the sushi burger which was probably about 3/5 stars - tasty but nothing out of the ordinary as you would expect from the description. The bento boxes are a great way to try different items if you like variety, and the quality is up there. I especially liked the thai cucumber salad - I even ordered two.

2195692,0,RTlvmyy3b0EQWZOzJBtojA,FAoO4sBlhugOvraqii2oFw,"Cowfish has been open for about 3 years & this place is still packed as ever! I've eaten here a number of times & DIDN'T have to wait only twice (one of those times was during lunch). It can get pricey, but the portions are big enough to last at least 2 meals (and no I'm not a ""dainty eater""). I will go into more detail about my first two visits because we had very different experiences with the food.

VISIT #1

Our first visit was actually on our 1st anniversary. BF & I couldn't decide where to eat, but we remembered that Cowfish opened a couple of months before so we headed over. We were able to get seated right away, but it was at a less than desirable table (right by the door in January?? brrrrr!) BF wanted to move to another table, but I'd been a hostess for a number of years & know how annoying it can get when customers keep switching tables on you, so I told him to deal with it & stay at this table. We were a bit overwhelmed by the huge, 10+ page menu, but our server made a few recommendations for us. We started off with some Sticks, Sweets, & Strings (3 S's) and BF ended up getting 1 burgushi (Taste Explosion) & another fusion specialty I can't remember & I ended up getting NOT a burger, but a ""knife & forker"" entree of stuffed eggplant (I believe these aren't on the menu anymore) & a Vegetarian Roll. 

The 3 S's were great! Copious portions of regular fries, sweet potato fries, & onion strings accompanied with a trio of dipping sauces.. artery-clogging goodness! I still get this on subsequent visits as well. BF liked his fusion specialty roll & thought the Taste Explosion roll was a bit odd, but at least he tried it! I wasn't really impressed with my eggplant but I guess that's partly my fault for ordering eggplant at a restaurant that specializes in burgers & sushi! However, my veggie roll was just alright, nothing special. It contained avocado, asparagus, & cucumber.. very basic stuff. We ordered the apple wontons for dessert & that was delish!

First visit we spent over $100 for a couple of drinks, 1 app, 2 entree-sized rolls, 1 knife & fork entree, a basic roll, & dessert and left pretty underwhelmed about the food. Service was exemplary, however. At the time, I probably would have given Cowfish a 2.5 rounded up to a 3. Good service & kinda pricey for ok food.

VISIT #2

My second visit was also with the BF. We went on his bday, a few months after our first visit. It was a Tuesday, & we were quoted a 30 minute wait, so BF gave them his phone number & we went to the mall to chill. After about 20 min, they gave him a call to let us know our table was ready.. but we still had to walk back to the restaurant from the mall so they held our table for us. We were seated at a much better table, away from the door.

I couldn't believe how packed it was on a Tuesday, but it must have been because of the half off 10 oz ""exotic"" martini special! You better believe I took advantage of that! I went with the Asian Orchid- raspberry sake, raspberry liqueur, and pineapple juice and also the Key Lime Pie- vanilla vodka, frangelico, fresh lime, & pineapple juice, with a graham cracker rim! Both martinis were excellent!

I had already looked at the menu beforehand so I already knew what I wanted. We started off with the 3 S's again & also the Chinese Chicken Salad without the chicken, cilantro, or green onion. This came with mixed greens, red & napa cabbage, bok choy, snow peas, red pepper, mandarin oranges, peanuts, carrot & beet curls, crispy wonton strips, & tossed in a peanut vinaigrette! It was pretty darn good, I must say! Big enough for both of us to share as well. 

For my entree, I decided to play it safe & stick with a burger- the Heavenly Veggie to be more specific. This wasn't the generic, frozen black bean burger you get at other places. Their house made veggie patty had brown rice, panko, cranberries, quinoa, roasted corn, spinach, edamame, & red peppers! Definitely the most unique veggie patty I have ever tried. The burger was served on a wheat bun with spinach, red onion, roasted red peppers, & avocado.. I also added some pepperjack cheese, pepperoncinis, & got a side of BBQ sauce.. what a delicious, monster-sized creation! It came with a side as well, so I got some more of those crispy sweet potato fries. My burger fell apart about halfway through, so I had to eat the rest of it with a fork.. nbd. I ended up ditching the bun & eating just the patty & toppings.

Overall, we were more impressed with the food this time around & the service was just as great as before. Since we had a better experience the 2nd time, we still come here & I have even brought a few friends who were visiting from out of town & they loved the concept & the food. I have been thinking about trying one of the bento boxes lately so I will have to force myself to get it next time, instead of the veggie burger!

2195706,1,HhYUDP1vR7CSRi2cvfai0Q,B5nMs0hyStuDxaavh9g9gQ,"So I think it's high time I review The Cowfish! I do believe my friend and I came here about 5 times a month every month last year!! Seriously when he finds a restaurant he likes he sticks with it.  That being said the wait time here is uber ridiculous.  We found that if you show up between 9-10 you don't have to wait though lol.  

Neither of us is a big fan of the giant specialty rolls they have as we tend to like less fussy sushi. So every week (usually Wednesday) we'd go in and order the same thing.  The Moriawase Double Deuce ( 6 pieces of nigiri, spicy tuna roll, and substitute the spicy yellow tail for the California roll), we'd also add another spicy tuna or spicy yellow tail and occasionally a bagel roll. Their spicy tuna is my favorite spicy tuna roll I've ever had in Charlotte. Everywhere else serves it minced except for cowfish and minced fish to me is kind of gross lol.  We always start with the minis of the day (miniature burgers) and generally either Saki or martinis.  Their martini selection is really good and they make a great dirty martini which is what he likes. I go for the specialty ones myself.  Personally I really like their sushi and their burgers are VERY good.  The fried pickles are great as well and you'd think it would be a hard thing to mess up but many restaurants in Charlotte do!  

Now we rarely have enough room left for desert but on occasion we get it, or I should really say that I get it and take most of it home.  I have a weak spot for their Fresh Berry Tall cake.  I mean a serious, I will go here and wait 45 minutes just so I can get it, weak spot!! Honestly it's nothing out of the ordinary.. all it consists of is lemon pound cake and vanilla bean ice cream layered and stacked 3 deep (of each layer). Then it is topped with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. However the lemon pound cake is to die for and for whatever reason completely resonates with me.  Just one of those things :-) I generally like to order it sans ice cream and take it home so I can have a slice of pound cake for desert for the next three nights!

Service here gets a good 4/5 rating. There have been a couple of misses but they were usually new. Otherwise the waiters tend to remember us and our order (we include a lot of substitutions).

We had a 45 minute wait( which was unusually short according to other people waiting) which is not bad because they text you when your seat is ready. So you can visit the shops around the restaurant. 

Started off with the tuna nachos and they were freakin awesome!! We had decided to try the burgushi even though the burgers and sushi looked amazing around us. 

I got lamburgushi and my wife got dougs filet roll. Dougs fillet was the way to go though. I got a yellow tail roll just to try some sushi and it was absolutely perfect. 

Great service and good food. Probably should expect a wait. It's first come first serve at the bar. Next time I'm just going to get a burger because I really wanted one after I saw a few come out.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2015-05-05,0,review,0

Every burger temp is exactly spot on.
Service is outstanding - food exceeds that, if possible.

The sushi itself is very good, but it's a little on the pricey side.

BUT, Cowfish does bring together two of my favorite foods - sushi and burgers and does them both surprisingly well!

Since I've only snacked on hubs' burger, I'll focus my review on apps and sushi. Let's get to it...

1) The scene: Super cool looking restaurant - very pop art-ish with custom sushi/Warhol esque paintings scattered on the red walls. Also, a huge bar and overall big concept (they took the Counter's space & the old Grape space - this place is magnanimous). Tons of tables in the bar area and general dining space. Make a reservation - it shall save you time! 

2) The staff: Sharp, knowledgeable and friendly on both accounts I've sat down for a meal here. They are able to walk you through the gigantic menu and help you focus on a few things that catch your eye. 

3) The menu: Huge. I mean Cheesecake Factory huge. Almost bordering on so large and detailed you can't take it all in. Think apps, burgers, burgushi, traditional sushi, creative sushi, make your own sushi, milkshakes, desserts, oh my. 

4) The food: De-freakin'-licious. A few things I've really enjoyed here...
-Crab Rangoon dip: Just as you would imagine, but better. Not for the dieting kind: fried wonton crisps, drizzled with sauce and dunkable in the crabby rangoony dip. Yes, please.
-Tropical Storm Roll: super fresh, delicious and huge. *Word to the wise, if you want to actually fit a piece of a sushi roll in your mouth, ask them to cut the rolls into 10 pieces instead of 8. Trust me...your jaw will thank me.
-Mango Tango Roll: Yummmm. I love just about anything with mango and this creative mixture is delightful. Plus - jalapeno! Nom.
-Fried pickles: Tasty and crunchy with a delicious dipping sauce. 
-White Diamond: Normally I shy away from panko, flash fried rolls but this is pretty flavorful! I may ask for a bit more heat next time, too. 

5) The prices: Honestly, pretty reasonable prices considering how much food you get to indulge in! Plus, the.sushi.rolls.are.huge. And the apps are pretty generous in size. Sharing is caring...share a few rolls with friends, you'll have plenty of food to go around. 

I also noticed that their lunch menu looks pretty slammin' and reasonable! So that's my long winded review of Cowfish. I really adore this chic fusion eatery and can't wait to go back!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2010-12-17,15,review,6

the place is nicely decorated and kinda fun. The aquarium is something I could sit and look at for hours while the fish play and chase each other. I especially like the little Cowfish, too cute.

there was a long wait for us, but I didn't mind. I didn't get to check out the touch screens on the bar but maybe next time.

they also have a really big patio that looks inviting.
 I noticed several staff who were dressed in a ""management"" looking way and that was expected but I have to say that a lot of the servers looked a little rough, some needed a shave and a hairbrush! 

on to our experience. there was myself, hubby and 13 y/o daughter. we started with the crab Rangoon dip. lots of crab in here! and it was very nice I admit, but I would've preferred not to have the sauce on the chips since it made them a little soggy. on the side would have been better.

we had a really nice server who pointed out the highlights of the menu and she was training someone who could have been a little more enthusiastic, but was nice enough.

next we tried the fried pickles, now I have had some great fried pickles but these missed that mark, they were a thicker cut thus the breading doesn't stick on them well and they weren't the crisp kind of pickle. although my daughter was in heaven since it has been a very long time since she has had any.

instead of ordering separately we ordered 3 different rolls of sushi and shared:
volcano roll- very spicy and is not for the faint of heart
spicy tuna roll- very nice but I like the spicy aioli on top not inside, but was still good
crunchy shrimp roll- was really good has some tempura fried shrimp in it.

we surprised my hubby with the typical song and dessert that restaurants do, he was thoroughly embarrassed - mission accomplished. 
the dessert was a enormous serving of moose on the loose. it was way more than we could share and oh so good and chocolaty!

we did not finish everything and ended up taking about 1/2 home and we all were stuffed beyond comfort.

2195717,1,XAh8KAJtPqQ_o-Ndb9V_tg,sKvESBXCpYRtFEgQjKC4ww,"I was in town for business and met a friend for dinner. I should mention, I worked in a restaurant for 5 yrs, am a foodie and take my reviews seriously. My friend, is culinary school educated and has been a chef for 11 years. We know service and we know food. 

This was my first time at Cowfish after hearing rave reviews from my friend if their burger rolls aka ""burguishi"".

The restaurant was busy and no seats were available at the bar. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. While people watching we saw a few patrons with children which was off-putting. I honestly would not bring a child here unless they were over the age of 10. It's just not the appeasable scene. 

We were seated by the manager whose friendly candor was very much welcomed by me & my friend. I wish I remember his name, but he is the type of person that gives you a good impression and gets you excited. 

Unfortunately, our assigned waiter was far from savvy as the manager we met. The waiter appeared rushed. So much so that in his haste he failed to listen each and every time. I requested hot green tea. He informed me they don't have green tea, but a citrus one and mumbled. It wasn't until he left that I realized he was gonna bring me iced tea. NOTE: A hot tea patron and an iced tea patron are two different classes of patrons. When he returned with the ICED tea, I informed him that my intent was for a hot tea... He directed me to the page FULL of hot tea options. My friend took the iced tea as he had initially ordered water and I drank the hot. At this point, I was NOT impressed by the waiter. My friend was not convinced my upset was valid.

I ignored that the waiter referred to the special rolls as ""entree rolls"" suggesting a single order would satisfy. Two rolls per person is the standard, but there's no need to argue to someone who clearly was unfamiliar with the menu & the fate in general. We ordered our meals.

My friend wanted the large tuna roll that he has seen being ordered. The waiter unfamiliar with the menu or the popular items was unable to direct him and never asked his colleagues. My friend ordered a roll similar to what he thought was the popular one and modified it by switching the fish. He requested spicy tuna instead of salmon but was informed they only had tuna and spicy is via the mayo. :/ This is where this place began to lose my friend. I ordered as well. We previously ordered an appetizer which was very similar to Bonefish's bang bang shrimp.

The meals arrive, we begin to eat. We notice the tuna he requested never occurred and the salmon is still present. We alert the nearest server who was yet another manager and the waiter arrives as well. The waiter, although he wrote and spoke as he wrote the modification was very defensive that the order was not right. No apology did we receive. Instead of having him finish the wrong dish and bring a new one, the roll was removed. He sat and starved as I ate and another replaced about 10 minutes later.  Still, no apology not did we get the..."" Let us treat you all to a drink or a shared dessert"". Nope nuffin. And for that, they completely lost my friend. 

We finish our meal & get the bill. The iced tea was charged to us & no courtesy deduction of anything was made. Me being me, I leave a decent tip with a note for him to not be hasty in his service and to listen, apologize, satisfy & thank. Upon our departure, we run into the manager who seated us who asks how we enjoyed our meal and we reveal, honestly.

I hate to give bad reviews because the place is great. It an fusion and the clientele is blended and trendy. I'm not sure if the server was having an off day, is new or is used to waiting tables at Sonic, but I just need someone to pull him aside and teach him the right way. During our table side chat, we discussed how this guy was so clueless and would probably be embarrassed if we were to reveal who we were and what we knew. 

My friend moves to DC so I'm less likely to partake this location with him again, but I would go again if I had the chance. If ever presented with the same waiter, I would walk out. No second chances with that one. Sorry, not sorry.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,2,2014-11-16,1,review,0

When we ate there it was a very busy night so we sat at the sushi bar. Fun with touch screen games and menu ordering options, definitely something different. The server was certainly a bright spot of the experience. She was so friendly and outgoing and was on the ball with service and any help we needed. One shortcoming was she was very unfamiliar with the menu and any seasonal and fresh fish they currently had in stock. This is probably not her fault as the restaurant is new and apparently very busy, I think she may not have received the proper training. No worries though, because her wonderful personality more than made up for it, and she made a great recommendation for a roll.

I love love love everything about this place. Unfortunately, I live in Los Angeles so I have to wait til I'm in Charlotte a couple of times a year. I drive my husband crazy chanting Cowfish Cowfish until we arrive. 

First, the awesome atmosphere... The place is buzzing with positive vibes, friendly staff, chill cool decor, nice lighting, overall hip chic ambience. It's a perfect spot for me and hubby because I love sushi and sashimi. He won't touch the stuff. He's a meaty meat meat guy. Cowfish has the best of both. 

I ordered a gorgeous sashimi combo with huge fresh cuts of fish that were beautifully arranged on a bed of shaved ice complete with a banana leaf and an orchid. I felt like I was on vacation. It was delish! Hubby had a grass fed angus burger smothered in some craziness. Loved it. We shared an order of coconut battered onion rings which are outstanding with the tangy spicy sauce they are served with. I also had a yummy crisp pear sake which our awesome server stopped to fill every time my cup was empty almost by magic, no matter how busy he was. It was rather impressive I must say. What really blew me away was how he really went out of his way to try to accommodate us. I had a strange request which is I really enjoy chili oil and chopped jalapeños or serrano chilis when I eat sashimi. Although they do not use chili oil there, he emerged from the kitchen with sesame oil and the chilis even though I had already said it was no big deal not to have it. It says a lot about a server who is willing to indulge a customer in a random request no matter how busy he was. I'm not sure how to spell his name but it was pronounced Gin, like the drink. I think he deserves a shout out for being so accommodating and friendly. 

Obviously, I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a unique twist on the typical sushi bar with excellent food. Can't wait to go back in December. In the meantime, maybe consider opening a Cowfish on the west coast??",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2012-09-26,2,review,0

Check him out, so cool.

There is ALWAYS a wait, but they seem to manage it well.  They text you when your table is ready, so you can wonder off a bit to the nearby shops.  If the weather permits, they have great outdoor areas.  

I love the creativity in the menu from the spiked shakes to the many burgushi options and the favorite, bento boxes.  The bento boxes come with a burger slider, a few pieces of a sushi roll, a side (sweet potato fries and fried pickles are good), edamame & cucumber salad.  I am a huge fan of the mark's roll, rigs r&r roll, blackened tuna roll & miss moffit's roll.  The burgers are great too, but I forget which ones I've tried in the bento box (I think byron & lamb).

The wait clearly told me that people felt the same way. I ordered the Fusion Specialty Bento Box. It included a roll of my choice (Mark's) and the slider of the week. Food didn't take terribly long to arrive despite being so packed. The slider was average. I enjoyed the gorgonzola spread it came with but there was hardly enough on there to truly comment on it. The patty itself was decent, but not spectacular. The sushi roll was good. I really like inside-out rolls. The wasabi mayo added a good level of heat but I could have used with more fish. The sides were also mediocre. Sweet potato fries -- while tasty, not very creative. My friend got one of the hybrid rolls with beef inside and cheese on top, coming as a recommendation from the waitress. I guess being used to the coolness of raw fish the warm sushi was a strange sensation. They use chopped beef which kind of falls apart in your mouth and the thick fry breading makes it difficult to eat more than one or two. 

Overall, I thought service was helpful and patient with us. We were a pretty indecisive bunch. However, I found the restaurant misty kitschy and probably not somewhere I would frequent.

Staff- I've been here 3 times so far and they have yet to dissapoint. Last night I was there for Humm almost 4 hours (good thing it was a slow Monday night or else I would have felt bad). Our waiter was great, joked around a little, gave us his 2 cents on the menu, and let us continue to sit there and drink without being pushy. He did have to leave and someone else took over but she was very nice too and kept the drinks coming. All I remember is Moscow something. GET THAT DRINK!

Food was excellent! You cannot go wrong mixing sushi and beef together. I cannot wait to try more of their menu. My date had a burger.... little boring but we won't hold that against him.

So we were naturally excited to try out their dishes. We started with thr fried calamari and while the sauce has a swt and sour sauce tangyness the overall taste was very salty. It was so salty that while i was chewing on the calamari I also chewed bits of sea salt along with it. Moving on to the main entree we ordered the cowfish bento box which is a combination of sushi,  cucumber salad, swt potato fries, roll of your choice in my case california roll, edamame and a mini slider. While the selection varied it was again very salty. The california roll was mediocre, the edamame again salt chunks, swt potato fries a little soggy but okay and the cucumber salad I barely touched because I wasnt sure what it was suppose to taste like. However the mini slider bomb.com so I guess the winner here is the burger and surprisingly it wasnt salty or soggy but had just enough juicyness with savory and soft meat. I would stop by just for the ambiance and also because its kid friendly but would only order a burger instead of any sushi.

The second time I went was nearly a year later. Wanting to give the infamous Burgushi another try. This time I got the taste explosion. It was really quite plain and fell apart as soon as you picked it up since it's just crumbles of burger meat. Pretty disappointing. That said, the milkshakes are AMAZING.

Came here with a group of girl friends so I got to sample a bunch of dishes. First, the appetizers: Crab rangoon dip was rich and full of chunks of crab a delight to dip into with the fried wonton skins. And the Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos - also topped with a bit of that crab rangoon dip - had a great cut of slightly seared tuna on each wonton nacho, yum. 

Second, the entrees: I got the Motherload sushi platter (of course the most expensive thing on the menu) and the pieces of sashimi were, again, very fresh, and the sushi roll was damn tasty. It also came with a spring roll whose accompanying peanut sauce came in a martini glass-esque container. The presentation was pretty awesome, mostly because I wasn't expecting such a gargantuan amount of food. I got to sample the mango tango roll, which was great with fresh jalapenos adding a kick to the fresh mango topping, and the grouper entree, which I wasn't a fan of because it was too heavy and not flavorful enough. 

Now, third, and finally, the dessert: Creme Brulee was very nice, but the chocolate cake was better-than-your-last-boyfriend-at-his-best good. Man, no one spoke as we shoveled fork fulls of decadent chocolate cake into our mouths. Damnnnnn. Okay, I'm done, I swear. Gooddddd. Okay. 

Decor was modern and hip, lots of post modern pieces of art depicting sushi/fish/cow in some form. Hostesses were great in getting us seated. Bartender was helpful in recommending a good beer. Waiter was definitely trying hard to get everything right and was super friendly. Only thing might be that the menu can be a tad overwhelming because there are so many choices, but that's it.

Snazzy menu with unique dishes. Check.
Solid ingredients. Most definitely.
Adorable cow-fish mutant logo. Where can I buy t-shirts with this? 
Service that automatically offered to split a check for a table of 9. Double Check

Food. Half Check. I sort of came with high expectations but I will try to keep it objective. Serving sizes were huge. Our table was full before the entrees even arrived. I blame the menu. It makes you want to try everything. 

For appetizers we got calamari, ahi tuna nachos, fried pickles, and truffle fries. Truffle fries were the best--skinny cut and topped with creamy sauce. The topping of the nachos were great as well but I didn't care of the wonton. It didn't quite add to the flavors and fell apart before I could even eat it. Fried pickles, I guess, are a southern staple and unfortunately just not for me. Finally, the calamari was a major disappointment with the 2-1 batter-to-squid ratio. 

My entree was the 'taste explosion' roll which was disappointing. The flavors were interesting but there was too much rice in my roll and as a result turned into a carb-filled car crash when deep fried. For a generalist food fan, it might have been enjoyable, but it was much too heavy for a sushi roll.  I shared a spiked shake -- Sleepless in Brooklyn -- with a neighbor which was basically like your typical vanilla shake with some spiced rum and kahlua. Server recommended it and I'd probably try something more flavorful next time. 

I'm not sold on ""burgushi"" itself yet but I can't deny that this is a good restaurant. It has a lot of charm as well given the odd couple of burger and sushi as well as the strange voices and music playing the bathroom. Don't forget to sign up for the mailing list for a free appetizer coupon! A friend of mine got the Doug's filet roll which had rare filet mignon on top--I probably would have liked that better. P.s.

2196658,1,OeCbwPrKsCj1vjgdWkv1pg,fiHK4IwGJuTygWHbKyL6QQ,"So, after exchanging a couple of e-mails with someone from the management team at Cowfish, I made an effort to visit the restaurant.  You can read about my initial experience in my first review.  However, the person from the management team provided a reasonable explanation for why they are reluctant to seat too many patrons at one time (they don't want to overwhelm the kitchen staff and compromise the food quality).  Moreover, the person I exchanged e-mails with was very interested in making sure that my future experiences at Cowfish would be really good.  He even wanted to send me a gift card to compensate me for the inconvenience from last Saturday.  I turned down the offer for the gift card and the offer for ""special"" treatment.  I feel that a restaurant should do a good job of attending to everyone - not just folks who have complained.  But, I give the management a TON of credit for working so hard to make this restaurant successful.  

With that as an introduction, here's the scoop on Cowfish.  

The food was really good.  Surprisingly good, actually.  I ordered a cucumber appetizer with sweet and spicy sauce, and then I ordered two rolls.  One roll was a specialty roll - Mark's Roll - and the other was from their ""Burgushi"" menu.  All three items were excellent.  The appetizer was huge, and very reasonably priced.  The sauce/dressing on the cucumbers was tangy and spicy, yet it wasn't too heavy or too hot.  The special roll - Mark's roll - was fantastic.  It had jalapeno, tuna, cream cheese and a bunch of other items.  The roll was flash fried and served with a spicy sauce on the top.  The ""burgushi"" roll was called ""Doug's Filet"".  Basically, it was a Philly roll covered with filet mignon (seared slightly, but still very raw).  This roll was huge, and it was very heavy.  However, it was also very tasty.  I didn't like this roll quite as much as Mark's Roll, but it was still an item I would order again.  

My girlfriend also ordered a sushi roll - from the ""make your own"" menu - as well as a Cowfish bento box.  The Cowfish box contains a mini burger, a small roll, and some side items.  It's a great deal for $11.   

I was surprised to find that Cowfish is actually a good value.  The rolls I ordered were $14, but they were huge.  Two of them left me absolutely stuffed.  (In fact, I couldn't finish all of the food I was given.)  With the appetizer, three beers, the bento box, and three rolls our tab was $72.  Not bad at all for Charlotte.

A few last comments... Cowfish is really, really noisy.  The atmosphere is fun, but it isn't a place for an intimate conversation. And, unfortunately, the service still isn't great.  The folks we interacted with were very kind and helpful.  (Which was not the case last Saturday.)  However, the restaurant is so popular right now that they are struggling with some basic issues.  We waited almost ten minutes to get our first beers.  Our server was VERY apologetic.  He said the back up was due to it being half priced martini night.  That's not a very compelling excuse, though.  They know in advance that it is half priced martini night.  They know they are very popular right now.  It's important to have enough staff to serve all of the customers in a timely fashion.  At the end of the meal our server - an incredibly nice guy - seemed to go AWOL.  I think that this was due to his waiting on the manager to come by to visit us as first time customers.  It's nice that the manager checks in with first time customers (even giving out a coupon for a free appetizer on the next visit), but I value my time more than I value a free appetizer.  I was tired and I was ready to go.  Yet, we didn't have our bill.  

I would give Cowfish 3.5 stars right now.  I suspect that the service will improve over time, and I can easily imagine it becoming a 4 star restaurant.  I certainly look forward to going back.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2011-03-23,2,review,1

2196660,1,4xFJ8ki8tSCKTRt90OaVUQ,ZM_iqvgZS23xVuMChaB0qw,"My husband had visited Cowfish once and helpfully warned me that the menu was bordering on bible-length, so I did us all a favor and studied up before coming. We came at 5:30 on a Sunday night and while it was not yet slammed, I could tell that it was about to get crazy. What tipped me off? Wait for it...

Our server gave us outstanding recommendations- I ordered the ahi nachos (slathered with their insanely good crab rangoon dip) and the Firecracker Roll (tempura shrimp and kani with raw fish on top and ponzu sauce), my husband had the bento box with Mark's roll (deep-fried tuna roll with jalapenos and cream sauce). I love sushi, I've spent many years and countless dollars in pursuit of sushi deliciousness. So many places try very hard to be inventive with their sushi menus- Cowfish was successful. Everything we had was excellent quality, generous in portion, and fun. I do think they could make everyone's life easier and cut 25% of their menu off (at least!)- I seriously wonder if this contributes to the long wait times. But overall, food is killer.

Our server, though great with suggestions, beverage refills, etc gave me the worst feeling from the second we sat down that we wanted us to hurry up, eat, and leave. Or possibly he was just tragically over-caffinated. The impression that he wanted us to leave was heightened by the bizarre move of taking the empty beverage glass and replacing it with TWO full glasses of lemonade. That is just weird, dude. I should note that we sat down and ordered almost immediately and didn't linger in the slightest- mostly because I felt that he might freak if we did. Kidding. We had to leave for a movie.

The 'something for everyone concept' works and I like the decor so I give it 3 stars because when the food is warm, timely and well cooked it's a nice place to have a drink, grab a burger and shake or some americanized sushi.

However, the problem with Cowfish is that they are consistently off the mark, whether its one thing or a combination of things I list some of the negatives in the half dozen times we've visited: cold burgers, cold fries, bad sushi, slow service, rude service, over cooked food, long hair in a burger, wrong orders... need I go on. After giving this place multiple chances to put right any 'newly opened' glitches, my friends and I have given up and stopped visiting. That's a shame because we all live within walking distance and used to visit a lot.

The female bartender (again, wish I could remember her name!) could see we were agitated and went and spoke to the manager who came over and thanked us for moving and gave us 2 free appetizer cards to use on our next visit.

For desert do not miss the milkshakes!  I can not pick a favorite because I get a different one every time!

We tried going once before, but the wait was so long we ended up turning in our buzzer and eating else where.  This was a Tuesday evening and yet it was still packed! I didn't make reservations because I thought with it being a week day the wait would not be as long......epic fail! We were told the wait would be any where between an hour and an hour and a half! We actually ended up waiting and hour......so my suggestion is to MAKE reservations! 

Once we got in, the electric atmosphere quickly helps you forget about the long wait.  If it's just you and a date, you can always ask to be let in and sit at the bar, but for that extra special feeling, I would suggest getting a table.  My date and I were seated at a small cramped table in the corner.  Our waiter Mike was very pleasant and efficient.  I ordered the Bagel roll, and an appetizer of Chicken Satay.  The bagel roll is great fro those who can only take so much sushi.  It's lightly cooked salmon, rice, cucumber rolled in rice and covered in sesame seeds.  The Chicken satay is great....the best thing about it is the celery salad/garnish that it comes with.  The celery is cut into fine slices and there is a vinaigrette spread over it....delicious!

The service was so fast....we got our  sushi rolls, prior to our appetizers, but no complaints here!  All in all, the Cowfish is an interesting spot, definitely a date destination.

The food is hot, plentiful, inexpensive for the quality, and DELICIOUS EVERY TIME.

My husband loves the fine onion strings but also asks for the horseradish aioli. :)  Our favorite dessert (although I must admit we can't get past the deliciousness to try any other...) is the Triple Berry Tall Cake.  Be warned... it is HUGE!  Moist lemon pound cake with premium vanilla bean ice cream, fresh whipped cream and berries.  It always tastes so fresh and ""summery""!  

This is our favorite restaurant in Charlotte and we have been to MANY.  We recently took our son for the first time (he is vegetarian).  He ordered the vegetarian sushi (not sure of the name) and it was delicious, also.  We all loved it.  He is taking a date back for a birthday celebration this Friday. It was a hit!  

My friend loves the Pimento Cheese burger (served with a fried green tomato on it) served with fried pickles.  She is so stuck on it she has never tried anything else! It seems whatever you order the first time has a hold on you here! :)  

Be sure to try the Dreaming Tree (Dave Matthews Band) Cabernet Sauvignon!

Apparently, I am a weak-willed women because I eventually gave in to my curiosity a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try. 

My boyfriend and I arrived around 9 o'clock and were shocked to see a flock hungry patrons sitting outside, beepers in hand, waiting for a table. We went inside to put our names down and were very impressed with the interior of the restaurant. I am not really one of those people who pics a restaurant based on the design or how 'cool' it is but this certainly worked in Cowfish's favor. 

After our number came up and our beeper started flashing, we were taken to our table and greeted by one of the friendliest waitresses I have ever encountered. We told her we had never been there before and she proceeded to guide us through the very large menu, answering any questions we had as she went. 

We proceeded to order the blackened ahi tuna nachos for our appetizer and we each chose the bento boxes for our entree. When the nachos arrived, I was in awe of how big they were. The 'nachos' are actually fried wontons and they are topped with their crab rangoon dip, pico de gallo, avocado, greens, and delicious ahi tuna. I took my first bite and literally fell in love. The tuna was fresh and all of the toppings tasted like they had been sliced and prepared to order. We scarfed them down in minutes and resisted the urge to place an order for more. 

Our bento boxes arrived soon after finishing the appetizer. I was amazed to see a huge selection of food with very generous portions. The box contained their mini burger of the week, the bib, which was served on a brioche bun with cheddar cheese and chili. The burger was tasty and fulfilled my desire for the comforts of The Counter fare. We moved on to the sweet potato fries (crispy and well-salted), Thai cucumbers (really delicious), and edamame (pretty standard). We saved the sushi roll for last, I selected 'Mark's Roll' which was spicy with jalapeno and siracha and very well-made. My boyfriend had the rainbow roll which was not as good as my roll but still very good. 

We had a great experience at Cowfish-- great food, great service, great atmosphere. I have been back since then and will continue to come back for fabulous food.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2011-06-04,8,review,4

We sat at the bar, She had her Box and me a Burger recommended by the waiter, food was delicious, took the wife nearly 15 mins to get her wine after the waiter took the order and after eating 20+mins no waiter, no check and no reorder on the wife's wine. 

We did stop a waitress to advise, few mins passed still no one. 

I finally reached out to a manager walking by and he advises he went on break, someone should have informed you, (You think? was my first thought)

Then he did reword it correctly by someone should have picked up the slack and we dropped the ball. 

This mangers name ""CHRIS"", He was a super hero flying in to fix an issue that should never have happened, seamless is the word that comes to mind.

He took our check and charged us and as the Chris is standing there he says ""wait let me take care of that.""

I don't know why, but Cowfish always pops up in my head for a place to take my friends/family from out of town to. And, they all liked or loved it!

Service - good to great. I have had great service, but then I have had good. Overall, they get you what you need in a timely manner.

Food - they have something for sushi and non-sushi lovers. So you have your burgers (which I am a fan of of Swiss burgers) and shakes (love love LOVE orange dreamsicle).

However, the mgrs. were willing to accomodate by bringing over additonal benches if possible. 

Our waiter was more than helpful. For whatever reason, we were given one waiter for our large group, so he was constantly getting this and checking on this. He was as attentive as he could be for the large crowd. I would have liked another dedicated server to ensure that no one was without drinks, plates were being cleared, etc.

Our food took a while to come out.  One of the rolls were forgotten so it came out after our burgers and was never really eaten.  We both enjoyed our burgers a lot.  Unfortunately it was a few weeks ago and I can't really remember the specifics.  The onion straws were delicious.

It is one of our favorite spots around Charlotte, and a plus for us is that it's close to home! You cannot beat the unique vibe and menu that they offer. 

You will feel the good vibes from the second you arrive, they always open the door for you and the staff have without fail been a group of friendly and helpful individuals. Now, to all beware, dinner time and ESPECIALLY weekend nights: you will wait!! BUT! It is worth it and you will not be able to deny that. They have a pretty good system in place, I believe now you can add your name to a list via an app before you even get there. They provide corn hole out front to entertain you, often times you can slip into a spot at the bar, and they really do move and try to get you in as quickly as possible. The reason for the wait is just because they do not accept reservations. If you want to sidestep this part of the experience, lunch is ideal for you.

Now, once you are seated, prepare to read the novel menu. Don't overlook or skip over something because it sounds like it won't work or you think it won't taste good--this is a place to try new things and your taste buds will be rewarded for you bravery, I swear! They also have a wonderful cocktail menu and their hot teas are delicious and budget friendly. For the low price you get more servings of tea than I believe a human can consume in one sitting. (My favorite is the vanilla mint chai)

I personally love their outdoor patio. They have fans and/or overhead heat lamps, whichever season you are dining they are ready for you. They have the tables, a cozy seating area with couches, and a fun game section with a life size connect four...fun for both adults and children alike. 

My favorite menu item I recently have become obsessed with is the grilled salmon salad!! It is absolutely huge and has the best combination of flavors. The sesame encrusted goat cheese just makes it even more heavenly and I could probably eat a whole plate of these little lovelies on my own. You of course need to eat some sushi, it is consistently fresh and well made. I have yet to try a milkshake here but it seems like they are a hit and I constantly crave one every time I look, I am just waiting for my conscience to lower its guard so I can order one someday :)

The hostess was very accommodating though and totally looked out for us - so it wasn't like my friends and I got neglected.  

Now, I did not have the pleasure to go to the counter, but my friend Chelsey was describing the old set up, but it looks like Cowfish took the idea and added and edited to get this great fusion/unique restaurant.  The bar wraps around the entire restaurant so it can seat a ton of people - not really sure if you could just walk up and plop down [since we were waiting on a table] but it looks like you could.

As it turns out one of my buddies is a server here so we were lucky to sit in his section and he walked us through the menu... which was a novel.  And an exciting novel at that!  There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, it seems like you can go here probably 20 times and order something new... maybe more.

We put an order in and eagerly awaited our food.  The wait for our table actually worked to our advantage since we got there a little early for dinner, but by the time we sat down we were starving and primed for a good meal.

2196694,6,skFw-hYJHT3Po0oE-WLbEA,vkkJtjuUyds4BaU7bdgPrg,"Is something really ""hype"" or ""hyped up"" if it fully lives up to its expectations?  Coming from out of town, I had not heard any ""hype"" about Cowfish. I was just in the area and as usual, let trusty Yelp guide me to a place that looked good.  I read a few reviews to get an idea of what to order, but it was not until I started to read more, that I realized that this restaurant had a reputation to live up to.

We were intrigued that this restaurant specialized in two things our family loved: burgers (my husband & boys) and sushi (me!).  Starving, we made our way over for lunch on a Friday, only to be told it would be a half hour wait.  The wait was only about 20 minutes, which gave me a chance to explore the lengthy menu and look at yelp reviews for food suggestions. We were all ready to go when the very friendly server came for our order. 

Warning:  I think just reading what we ate for appetizers might give one coronary artery disease!  The two Moms and their teenage daughters (eating their salads) sitting at the next table looked at us in both horror and envy as we chowed. All I could tell them was, "" Eating is different with little boys!""  They laughed and said, ""We wish we got what you did!""
We had:  Coconut Battered Onion Rings ($6), served with a horseradish aioli & Thai sweet dipping sauce. I am not usually an onion ring fan but i did taste these, especially because I love to dip. They were huge, crunchy,& delicious!
Crab Rangoon Dip ($11) - great recommendation by yelpers! Unusual, creamy, yummy!
Parmesan Truffle Fries ($8) - with Parmesan cheese & bacon. So tasty! Really sinful!  The apps alone left me stuffed!

They have more unusual burgers at Cowfish than I have ever seen. Husband & 11 year old shared two: 1) the Hunka Hunka Burnin Love ($16):  Yes, a burger with peanut butter, fried bananas, & bacon. You could almost hear Elvis singing! It was good, but not as great as burger #2) the Arnold Hamandegger ($13):  cheese, ham, fried egg, bacon, grilled onions, cowfish sauce, onion roll. 

9 year old and I each had our own Bento Boxes. These are combo meals with a mini burger, sushi roll, thai cucumbers, sweet potato fries, & edamame. It is really the best of both worlds and it was a fantastic choice!    9 year old got the Cowfish Bento Box ($9) which came with a plain mini burger and he chose a Philly Roll, which he loved. I got the Ultimate Bento Box. I really did not care much about the double stack featured mini burger. I thought it was somewhat dry and I just tasted it. I got the ultimate because I wanted to try one of the special rolls.  There are many unique rolls (as well as sashimi, nigiri). You can even create your own roll. I tried ""The Boss"" and it was original, satisfying, and delicious:  Spicy tuna, kani salad, cucumbers inside, coated in tempura flakes, topped with avocado, tuna, etc. 

Service was very friendly and efficient.  Our server even pointed out that Joey Fatone was in the house. Woo hoo!  The manager (possibly owner?) stopped by to see how everything was and I begged him to open a place in Fort Lauderdale.

I was content to initially order a Philadelphia and a spicy tuna roll. I was chastised heavily by the gal behind the bar who, to her credit, convinced me to go for something more unique to the establishment.

I ended up splurging for two of the rolls that were around $20 each. I thought to myself that $20 for a roll is excessive, but as it turns out, these rolls are massive so it's not an entirely unfair price.

The rolls were excellent. One came with a side of poke (pronounced po-kay) tuna (Tazmanian Devil) and the other was great as well, The Boss.

Definitely give this place a look, but expect to spend $25-50 per person if you're going strictly sushi and want to try their ""sushi fusion"" items.

this place is just way too overpriced and overrated. the sushi is better at most other places in charlotte. the drinks are, however, really good even though they're overpriced.

They traded out alcoholic beverages for anyone who did not care for theirs.  No questions asked.  Accomodated special requests perfectly.  Presentation was great.  Timing for such a large group that had both a combination of raw & cooked items was right on.

The menu is so extensive with rolls that you don't see anywhere else in the Fusion specialty section be warned that it could take a while to decide.

Overall ambience is pretty noisy & having to really speak up so the person next to you can hear you.  Reservations are definitely recommended.

The mgr provided 2 free appetizers - the sweet & spicy thai cucumbers & the Ahi tuna tini.  Both appetizers were fantastic!  We had a couple of sushi virgins with us who gobbled the Ahi tuna tini.  It was phenomenal.

The rolls are so large that definitely have them cut into 10 pieces.  I had the Nirvana & the blackened tuna roll.  Both were a-ok.  

The Blackened tuna roll was a lot of rice & expected more fixings with how it was described.  

The Nirvana roll was the better of the 2.  The caution here is that it is whitefish so if you aren't in the mood for fishy taste compare it to being in the mood for a more gamey meat option like quail than don't go with the Nirvana.

Although we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, we were able to enjoy the restaurant's positive atmosphere and unique artwork from the bar until we were seated. One of the waiters even noticed us admiring the art and was nice enough to give us a few postcards of some of the paintings. That, my friends, is a prime example of quality service!! 
For dinner, my brother built his own burger, my mom got the Dion's OMG! Roll, my dad ordered the Screamin Korean Chicken Sandwich, and I ordered Mrs. Woodbury's Fresh Find sushi roll. First of all, let me say that I have never seen my family so quiet during dinner. And this wasn't a bad thing!! The food was literally so good no one wanted to stop eating in order to speak! My sushi roll was so fresh: the salmon was buttery, the side of fresh tuna poke was delectable, and the avocado was incredibly creamy!! It is by far one of the best FRESH rolls I've had. Almost any sushi roll that has tempura or cooked fish in it can be good, but it is hard to find a completely raw roll that stands out, and this one sure did! I also had a piece of the Dion's OMG! Roll and literally...OMG!!! The name describes it way too well. The coconut shrimp gives that roll such a unique flavor! It's safe to say that my taste buds and tummy were extremely happy!!

Going in, I knew this place would either be amazing or a terrible decision for my stomach but I had to try it. Glad I did! Although it's probably making Japanese sushi chefs everywhere cringe, this American twist on sushi tasted amazing. 

We visited mid day and were seated immediately. The waitress gave us a full rundown of each section of the menu, which was an extensive variation of burgers, sushi, and BURGUSHI(we will get to this later). To start, we order the crab Rangoon dip which was delicious. The chips had a drizzle of Sweet Thai chili sauce. Everyone at the table loved it. Next up I chose the Brento bento box which came with 2 burger sliders, 4 pieces of one of their specialty roll sushi, and your choice of 4 sides. I upgraded my burger sliders to add some pulled pork on them and chose the firecracker roll for sushi. Those were legit some of the best sliders I've ever had. The flavor that they were able to achieve in the sliders were great. The sushi was amazing and super fresh as well. The Brento bento box was a ton of food and I was stuffed after it. 

Of course we also couldn't come cowfish and not try their Burgushi - which takes the traditional sushi roll and adds some red meat items instead of fish. Others at the table ordered the nature boy roll with bison in it so I sampled it. This roll was a complete flavor explosion. It was so good we almost ordered another to go. Now I'm going to have to go back a try all of them! Definitely a fan of this spin on sushi.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2016-07-04,1,review,1

To begin, the menu is comically big, whenever I see a menu that long, it automatically is an issue. 

For the traditional sushi rolls - the cost/value is all off.  17 bucks for a sub-par tempura shrimp roll does not seem right.  Fusion rolls, I had the BBQ, and the bbq was not tasty and the roll seemed forced.

2196734,8,hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA,zKle00pkpmibvJZ065JlmA,"It was my last meal in Charlotte this go 'round, after another extended 5-day weekend visiting my parents, and I knew I really wanted something different before leaving. Having eaten my fill of Southern style specialties while staying at home with them, my radar began blinking frantically when I did a quick search for new (relatively) places in Charlotte since my last visit. Having worked in the area for many years selling wine I had already been to most of the more unique spots in the city, and then I stumbled upon what surely had to be a typo...The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar? Ummm, what? Then, my mind flashed to my last trip here over Christmas and some shopping that was done at South Park mall. I recalled riding past a place with a burger and sushi on the awning, and my immediate reaction at the time was a similar ""what the hell?"" Well, nothing more had to be said. I didn't even have to pull up the menu to know this would be my destination for lunch.

When we arrived at our destination, which you would likely never find if you weren't specifically looking for it, it was a bit past prime lunch hours (somewhere between 1 and 1:30), but the restaurant was still surprisingly hopping for a Monday afternoon. I passed up the chance to eat outside, as you have no idea what the patio space looks like upon entering. This was a mistake, not because the inside was bad, but because after I saw the nice large patio adjacent a beautiful fountain I really wanted to be eating out there. Sitting inside did offer a vantage point of the strange and humorous wall art, half mocking half embracing the fusion of burger and sushi, along with an enormous fish tank and easy access to our server. A quick trip to the restroom revealed another of Cowfish's oddities, a foreign language ""learn to speak Japanese"" track playing, combined with what could only be described as ""learn to speak Redneck"" version. Hearing the cute little J-pop voice followed by Cletus was certainly a shock, and I made another visit before leaving just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating (and I had to rinse an obscene amount of grease from my beard).

The real reason for coming here though is obviously the strange mix of food offered on the enormous menu. First are the appetizers, some of the best meal starters I've seen offered. This isn't your typical ""hey let's fry something or add cheese to it"" type of appetizer. They're all well thought out and incorporate a breadth of flavor profiles. Then you've got a page full of burger options, followed by several pages of very creative sushi rolls, and finally their signature item, a combination of burger and sushi they've deemed burgushi. It sounds like something the bumbling idiot Fabio from Top Chef would pronounce, but the concept is actually quite appealing when you see the menu descriptions.

I began with a couple appetizers, hoping my mom would assist me in eating them so I would have room for a burger, and the ""Mother Load"" roll, which features a piece of every fish on their menu in one hell of a creative presentation. I wound up eating both of them by myself though, so I had to cut out the sushi. I started with the blackened Ahi tuna nachos, which are wonton chips topped with crab Rangoon dip, pico de gallo and avocado and some seared tuna. I thought the quality of everything in this item was superb, although the crab dip definitely overtook the flavor of the tuna. It really benefitted from just a few drops of added Sriracha to help balance all the flavors. Next up I dove into the Caribbean summer rolls, which have boiled shrimp, lettuce, mint, mango, cucumber and chive, and when combined with their spicy peanut sauce they were actually some of the best spring rolls I have ever had, anywhere. The size was huge too, definitely worth the $9 price tag if you're debating which appetizer to order.

In between the appetizers and our burgers came the only real faux pas of the meal by Cowfish, and that was actually delivering our burgers just minutes after our appetizers had arrived. I had eaten literally one and a half of the big nachos, and not even begun on the rolls, when both our burgers were brought out. I decided not to complain and just go along with it, mixing bites from everything at once, but then I bit into my burger and realized that the medium rare I had requested was actually medium well, and produced no juice whatsoever. This I had to say something about, and it was promptly remedied by the chef, and comp'ed off the ticket by the manager. 

1) Businesses take note, that's how you take care of a customer. 
2) Yelpers take note, that's how you correct an error without bitching about it and deducting stars.

As for the actual burger, I went with the Arnold Hamandegger (self explanatory), and when properly done was wonderfully juicy, with just the right amount of egg yolk seeping over the bacon and ham. The ""Cowfish sauce"" was pretty tasty too, and the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2011-04-20,9,review,9

We ventured over to Southpark around 7:30 and told it would be an hour and half wait. We were starving, but had already committed so we decided to order a bottle of wine from the bar and the crab Rangoon dip, and go sit outside in the gated area. The bar, like the rest of the restaurant, was packed, and our bartender looked like he was miserable. We hoped it wasn't going to be an indicator of our night, and it definitely wasn't.  After spending only 30-40 mins on the patio, our buzzer went off. We contemplated waiting longer for a table on the patio since it was such a beautiful night, but at that point we were ready to eat. 
So we went up to the host stand and took our wine and glasses with us. We were slightly disappointed that man that took us to our table, never offered to assist us, even after one of his co-workers suggested it. We had a table in the back of the restaurant, near the patio. The breeze from the door opening and closing was refreshing. It is definitely a date night kind of restaurant with the dim lightening and cozy atmosphere.

Food: The crab Rangoon dip was a very solid choice. It was a generous portion of chips with a side of dip. Between us three girls, we cleaned the plate.
Entrees: I ordered the Nature Boy Wooshi Buffalooo-shi roll. Besides the fact that I struggled to pronounce its name, it was delicious. Chipotle Bison, onions and feta cheese, topped with tomato chipotle aioli, onions, tomatoes, and a slice of a jalapeno. My only issue with this roll was it was soo big! I literally swallowed a jalapeno whole because I tried eating it in one bite. Epic fail on my part, so daters take note, cut this roll up before eating.

The surf and turf roll: Angus beef, cream cheese, topped with tuna, salmon, mushrooms, masago and a cream sauce. This roll was equally amazing and I really enjoyed the flavor the mushrooms brought to the roll. I tasted the beef more than the fish, but it was overall balanced well. 

Dessert: We all ordered milk shakes, but I felt mine was the best hands down. I have the cake shake and it was delicious. It was thick, sweet with vanilla flavor and literally tasted like cake. The other shakes were the mint chocolate chip, which held true to its name and was very minty and the Carmel Chocolate espresso malt. I am not big on coffee flavor items, so I passed on tasting that one, but it got good feedback from the crowd.

I would definitely come back again on half-priced wine night, aka Wednesday, and would love to sit on the patio next time.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2013-04-16,1,review,1

The restaurant is famous for both their burgers and sushi, especially the fusion of the two, and the name is? wait for it....""Bergushi""! 

Coming from an Asian background, never would I have thought sushi and burgers would go well together, so I had to give it a try!!!

I ordered their popular Bergushi-- ""Taste Explosion""! The plate had sushi rolls evenly spread out, topped with different sauces with a hint of pesto on top. The rolls looked like as if their were fried, but it's actually the tempura crust (which is deep-fried). 

First of all, the dish looked amazing, and as I put it in my mouth, the taste LITERALLY EXPLODED in my mouth. The burger meat with different veggies and a layer of bacon wrapped around by the tempura sushi rice, The beef, sushi rice, celery, carrots, onion, bacon, pesto, slice of tomato...etc, all come together and bust in your mouth!!

Side note: cell reception (att iPhone) is almost non existent. Good luck, iPhoners.

First off, we were starving. We had just gotten back from a camping trip and were ready to gorge on our silverware if we had to. Started off with a couple of beers. OMB and Blue Moon. Always amazing. Let me say that presentation of water is never anything to bat an eyelash at, but Cowfish makes you think twice. Served in a glass milk bottle. Uhh...hello, badass! 

For apps, we ordered the sticks, sweets and strings. If you have a small army of fried food-loving people to feed, this is the appetizer for you. Piled high with sweet potato fries, onion straws and amazing seasoned fries. 

Entrees:

My wife got the green monster, veggie style. So good and topped with an array of chiles and fried jalapeños. Cucumbers were a nice touch and relief from the inherent heat. 

I ventured into burgushi land for the first time. Went for the taste explosion as it was our server's recommendation. I'm at a loss for words. The texture: odd but welcomed. The composition: pretty large. Nicely done and plated beautifully. The flavor: this is where I struggle. So many flavors. The nori, sticky rice, beef, jalapenos and bacon were so savory but separate. Right amount of heat. Just hard to land on whether or not its groundbreaking. Let's say my interest has been peaked and I'm ready for the next roll on the menu. Bring it on, burgushi!

2196768,1,LLsIYxkkqLczxt0XnafrPQ,0V8qWbe1n4wj3OWmMbtNHQ,"Yo, so I'm cruising around Charlotte and wanted to find something to eat, had a friend recommend this place and I was blown away!

First off, it's a pretty popular place so if you're here on a Friday night with a party of more than 4, expect at least a 40 minute wait. Cool thing is, they'll text you about your wait status just in case that little vibrating thing. 

When you're seated, notice the decor behind the sushi station. I thought it was the cutest thing with their attention to detail. This place is a fusion between sushi and burgers so you'll see a mix between soy sauce bottles and ketchup/mustard bottles. 

Now, I took some of the advice of my fellow yelpers and started with the crab rangoon dip. Now, I can't say i'm a master of crab rangoon, but it was pretty awesome. Nice texture, i like that the deep fried chips had sweet and sour sauce on it for some added flavor. 

Since it was only my girlfriend and I, we opted for a burger and a sushi plate and shared. Ordered the blackened tuna roll and also the jalapeno-popper-show-stopper (say that 5 times fast) burger with a side of sweet potato fries. What was cool was that since we were sharing, waiter went ahead and have the kitchen split our meal into two plates instead of us having to do that awkward ""Can I have an extra plate and knife please"" routine. So props to you my friend! 

The burger had jalapeno and the waiter did say it was spicy but that's because he doesn't do spicy well, but I didn't think it was spicy at all. The burger was cooked medium-rare (how I love my steaks and burgers) and the jalapeno added a nice kick but nothing too spicy. I would say if you can handle hot fries, you can handle this without a problem. 

As for the sushi, decent. I can't comment on how great it was or whatnot because I think I liked the burger more and that the sushi just didn't stand out in my opinion. 

The fries though, solidly deep fried with a pinch of salt for flavor. This is legit sweet potato fries right here, none of that BS sloppy, limp fries once it gets to your table. These are still piping hot and crispy. I loved them. 

Don't be scared of the menu (I know I was when I first saw it). There's A LOT of stuff to choose from. Just ask your server for recommendations and I'm sure they'll steer you in the right direction. 

If I was in the area again, definitely would try this place again.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-06-03,6,review,2

2196770,4,c8cur4lMkQsHoUEqm-qwxg,Is-zXV4dm1G1wjhVKlRjkw,"How many places do you know that serve sushi, burgers and burgushi (combine them both) in one restaurant? Exactly, none...for that reason Cowfish deserves a 5-star review. They back it up with their great food, menu and service. Been here at least 10 times and it's safe to say I've tried a lot of menu items. I usually sit at the bar because there's always a wait when I get there. Bartenders are knowledgeable and quick with their service. 

As for the menu. The sushi is really good. Not as good as some specialty sushi restaurants around town, but the rolls are unique and large. Recommendation...ask the rolls to be cut in 10 pieces vs. 8 so they are more manageable. The burgers are really good. This is my favorite part of the place. The Green Monster burger has avocado, pepparjack and jalapenos on it! They're also at least 1/2 pound...big! Choice of sides are abundant, but sweet potato fries are usually the norm. On a recent visit I went with the Ahi Tuna burger, which was very tasty and had a nice Asian slaw on it. 

But for something unique and light, go with the bento box...definiately for lunch. Comes with 5 sections. Small (4 piece) roll of your choice (think there's 3-4 options), a mini burger of the day, sweet potato fries, edamame and cucumber salad. A little bit of everything for those that can't decide because the menu is so BIG. 

My only two complaints are 1)the menu itself, as it's so big. Everything Ive had on it has been good, don't get me wrong...you just need a solid 5-10 minutes to look it over, hence the reason for multiple visits and 2) PBR tallboys are $5. From one who loves PBR, this is just a laughable price. I look forward to enjoying the large patio when the weather is warmer.

The mini burger is good but it is tiny. The crab (cooked) sushi is really good. 

It was loud for us on a Sunday at lunch. Concrete floors make it louder. Lotta pots banging and the noise level was too high so you had to speak very loud to hear your guest. Would have been so much nicer if they would have designed it so materials would absorb the noise level.  Maybe we will sit outside next time.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2012-08-30,0,review,0

I love the Southpark area, and all it has to offer in regards to fine dining, and Cowfish did not disappoint. I must preface this review by noting that I do NOT mind paying more money for a satisfying meal. I find their prices to be very reasonable, considering the quality and presentation of the food. For a MONSTROUS roll, and the best assortment of edamame I have ever consumed, my total bill was around $22-24. 

If you love southern BBQ, as I have grown to love and crave, please try the deliverance roll. Pulled pork bbq is wrapped in the dried seaweed with rice and tempura onion straws, flash fried, and topped with bacon coleslaw and bbq sauce. Y'all have no idea how tasty this roll was! It was so tasty, in fact, that I had to throw a ""y'all"" in there! 

Most importantly, every morsel of food tasted fresh and clean, as they made sure to not cross-contimaniate my non-raw roll with their cuts of raw fish. Very professional, very trendy, my entire experience was delightful!

The atmosphere is VERY eclectic without being too busy. The service was excellent, and I even left a great compliment on a comment card. I will return for more :-)",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-01-08,2,review,1

Best sushi roll hands down is the Nirvana roll - highly impressed by that combo. But there is plenty of other options as well. Can't decide between the burger and the sushi? Get the burgushi... that's sushi on a burger. Or what I call a genius invention. Yet no matter what you order, ask for a side of Cowfish sauce. Great with beef entrees. 

Stop in on Tuesdays for half-priced martinis. The key lime pie martini is my favorite and comes with a graham cracker rim. Smooth, cool and not overly sweet like I expected. And I sometimes savor in the alcoholic milkshakes. Will they get you buzzed? Not at all but they're a great way to end a meal and perfect to share. 

And extra tip, join the Cowfish email club before you go - once you join, you receive a coupon for a free appetizer. I recommend the crab rangoon dip... plenty for the table and it's crab rangoon as a dip... that's #winning right there.

I think I could eat sushi everyday so for me to order a burger instead was a tough decision. I had the lamb burger, it was awesome!

First or all, the menu is one of the most interesting I have come across in all my travels. The hamburgers alone are not just plain old hamburgers. Buffalo or lamb anyone? Then you turn the page and there is sushi. But then you turn the page yet again and discover ""burgushi."" Fortunately, our waiter was kind enough to take us through the menu and made some great recommendations.

Unable to make a clear decision with so many interesting options, my colleague and I decided to order several items off the burgushi portion of the menu (the Taste Explosion Roll, the Deliverance Roll, and the Pittsburgooshi Sandwhich). Holy Cowfish! They were all outstanding!

My friend and I were looking for a great patio restaurant to enjoy the warm spring weather. I arrived first and was greeted at the hostess stand with an instant ""we're on a forty-five min to an hour wait"". Well, ok, I guess I'll just have a seat at the bar and wait. My friend had not arrived yet, so I people watched a bit and noticed that not only were there few guests waiting for tables and an empty bar, but there was also a fairly empty restaurant. The bartender explained that the waitlist was so the kitchen didn't get overwhelmed. So you're going to make me sit in your lobby- not spending money and possibly losing guests, because you don't want me to sit at a table- spending money and possibly very happily waiting with a drink and a spring breeze so the kitchen can keep up? I have worked in the service and hospitality industry for 15 years, I understand how wait times and staffing works, but an hour wait when I can count 20 people in the lobby/bar area and over 10 open tables? My friend arrived about 20 minutes into my wait-time and asked if I had remembered to request the patio. I had not, so he went to the hostess stand to amend our reservation and inquire about the long wait in an empty restaurant. He asked if the wait list applied to the patio and was told that they don't take reservations for the patio. Ok..So we just seat ourselves? Please remove us from the waitlist then, we'll go sit on the patio. We were handed menus in response so we walked back and found a nice table in the shade. We also found a patio of about fifteen tables with only the back section nearest the restaurant seated, the rest empty. Again, we questioned the hour long wait time with so many empty tables. Our server was very sweet and greeted us instantly, taking our drink order. We were then greeted by a gentleman manager who explained that we would have to be moved because he needed our table for a large group. We looked at all the empty tables and asked where he would like us to move. He explained that we would actually be put back on the waitlist, because the patio was full. Ok.. Why is it full with so many empty tables available and an eager and obviously bored server who had greeted us instantly a moment ago? He explained that it was a staffing issue, new restaurant, still working out the kinks of staffing.. blah blah blah.. dinner is on me tonight for the inconvenience. Our server arrived with drinks in hand, confused about why the manager was speaking with us. She then offered to pick up a table, because she had another table about to close out and would be able to take care of us at one of the unstaffed tables nearby. We had no interest in a free dinner, we just wanted to sit somewhere and have dinner. We looked to the manager who brushed off the suggestion, then demanded who had seated us at that table in the first place, the hostesses knew that he had need to seat a large party there. We explained the conversation that we had had with the hostess at the front, and the manager exclaimed that his hostesses never would have said that we could seat ourselves and which one was it, because she's just lost her job. Seriously? Again, you're putting your staffing issues on the guest? Well, she did say it, and I don't think it's necessary for her to lose her job over it. We'll just go across the street to Upstream if you need us to wait any longer. The server again suggested that we would be fine at the table next door, but the manager at this point seemed so focused on being right and disciplining his staff that he ignored her suggestion and we started walking to the exit. By the time we had gathered our things and reached the door, the manager and hostess in question approached, with the hostess in full denial (not to blame her, as the manager had already threatened her job). The manager then called us liars who had seated ourselves. Yes, we already told you we seated ourselves, but how do you think we got our menus? At this point, we were done arguing with this manager because it just seemed to us that he wanted to be right more than he wanted to make the situation amenable and display a little hospitality. Never again will I walk through those doors. I will not give my time and money to a place with exorbitant wait-times and ill-managed staff.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,1,2011-09-25,6,review,0

Loved the fried pickles, loved the thai cucumber salad (HUGE portions), and loved my sushi.  I was skeptical about a sushi joint that also does burgers but the burgishi boxes look adorable and next time we are in Charlotte this will be a must see.  My friend had a delicious burger which she was kind enough to share - they really have nailed it on both - burgers and amazing sushi in one spot - who woulda thought it?  

Manager did come to check on us after our meal and ask how everything was.  He made chit-chat and was friendly enough.  Server was excellent and our service was great.  Can't wait to go again!

** Also - for those who complain about the wait - this place is a must-visit and it's packed.  We were going to go on a Friday night but by the time we had decided this, it was 6:30 and my girlfriend wisely advised we'd have a 1.5 hour wait and to wait until the next day.  We went fairly early the next day and the hostess claimed a 30 minute wait but either time went by supa fast or it wasn't even 30 minutes.  We killed time in Crate and Barrel and thankfully the buzzer went off before I went hundreds of dollars in debt.  Great food here - so the wait would've been worth it, even twice as long.

So let us rewind to December of 2012 when my boyfriend got a really fantastic job offer in Charlotte, NC that would force us to relocate from Massachusetts. After a lot of soul searching, I gave in to this venture and came to Charlotte the weekend before Christmas for a house-hunting trip. I was prepared to hate it. I anticipated hating it. Before we left, my boyfriend let me plan us our first date in Charlotte so I made us reservations at Cowfish.
The menu was fantastic. Not only was our food delicious (and beautiful to look at) but it was reasonably priced and there was SO MUCH to choose from. You can't make a mistake but there are pages and pages of really exciting food options.
Moreover the restaurant itself is really gorgeous and clean and such an appeasing atmosphere and their staff are all really nice and accommodating. Usually there is always one drawback to a cool restaurant with good food but they've really got it all going on. They really made Charlotte look good to me. I'm glad that was my first impression. Cowfish is now one of our more sentimental special occasion restaurants. We were back a few weeks ago to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Fried pickles and coconut batter onion rings?

Top of the mountain. King of the Playground. Etc. Etc. And The Cowfish? Well let's just say that it's got serious potential to possibly send every other restaurant in town out of business and cure cancer. IT'S JUST THAT GOOD.

After coming here a few times on a few different nights, I have yet to find anything I don't eat, see or hear that makes me go ""Wow..."". From the service (Channon is one of the managers and went above, beyond and around the corner to make an order right for us one night), to the decor (so Japanese/modern/fun/dark/chic/simple - if that's possible?), to the food (Shut the Front Door Good!), it's just a fact that The Cowfish is really just that good.

Reservations are only accepted for 1/3 of the place, so they're hard to get but I've never had a problem strolling up to the bar and getting a seat. If that's not your thing, they encourage you to call ahead and get a feel for the wait time. Whatever it is, though, wait. It's worth it :)

We've tried the Summer rolls (4 to an order, with a few great fried chips plus a savory, light chili sauce for dipping) as well as the Crab Ragoon dip and both were top notch. So good you will consider ordering them as meals the next time you come in!

The Burgiri is just an orgasm in your mouth waiting to happen. So just try it and thank me later, OK? The actual sushi rolls are the freshest I've tasted in Charlotte - between the basic rolls (cali, philly) and the more complex specialty rolls, they're beautiful, well constructed and amazingly flavorful. A tip would be to ask the waiter to have it cut into 10 pieces - the rolls are a bit too big otherwise to fit in one bite!

I have not had the milkshakes yet, but will make that my priority when I go back (again) tonight! 

Ah, it's admittedly hard for me to write this review - can words truly fail me? I believe so - the moral of the story is go. Go try The Cowfish. Run, Drive and Speed towards in as soon as you can.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2011-08-26,4,review,4

Also, we ordered a PB&J sandwich for my daughter and they rolled it up to look like a piece of sushi-super creative and she was excited to eat it. Before we left the manager, Christie, came to our table to introduce herself and ask how our meal was. She said she heard it was our first time and gave us a coupon for our next visit.

I can imagine sitting around one drunken night and pondering ""What if we combined gourmet burgers with...sushi!."" It's crazy, but it really works.

The restaurant itself is your standard chic eatery. It's classy but not memorable, besides the bathroom where the radio teaches you to speak several languages (it's weird and you have to see it!). The alcohol menu is several pages with numerous options for beer, wine and cocktails. The food menu is so long that the server spent five minutes trying to explain it. This could be too much, but if you're with a picky eater, the dozens of options are greatly appreciated. There literally is something for everyone. 

There's a full page of creative half pound burgers ($11-$16) and another two pages of sushi. Then it just gets outrageous with burgers topped with sushi or sushi made out of burgers. It all is very fun and unique and I'd love to try the many combinations. After a delicious app of raw tuna nachos (tortillas with sushi grade tuna, guac and salsa) I decided on a bento box. But of course it's not your standard box. This was comprised of a mini Texas cheeseburger, a full order of fries, a specialty sushi roll (I chose the spicy Firecracker), thai cucumbers and edamame ($18). It was a ton of food and very good.  For dessert a Grasshopper minty milkshake was too thick at first but perfect after a bit.

The Appetizers
We ordered their Crab Rangoon Dip & Crispy Calamari. The Crab Rangoon was fantastic as was the Calamari. The sweet/spicy sauce they use is put on the plate and the Calamari over the top So I had the waiter bring a side of the sauce because it wasnt enough)

The Entrees
I ordered the CBCLT which is a Beef burger, sharp cheddar cheese, thick cut applewood smoked bacon, white cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato and onion. Served on brioche with our signature Cowfish sauce. Honestly may have been the best burger I have ever had Even better than a Kobe Burger in Tampa last year. It was juicy and just fell apart in your mouth. for a side I ordered the onion straws whch I wouldn't order them again (I like em but they are always so greasy, don't know why I try) but their shoestring french fries were great.

My wife order the Taste Explosion Roll which is Seasoned natural Angus ground beef, applewood bacon, fresh jalapenos and spicy cream sauce inside of a sushi roll coated with tempura flakes. Each piece is topped with marinated Roma tomato and pepper jack cheese, then baked to perfection. Drizzled with cashew cilantro pesto to finish. She loved it..for me I though it was good but for the price and what they give you I feel you would be better off with their normal Sushi which was a whole roll.

The burgers are good! I am not a very adventurous person when it comes to my burgers, but I enjoyed reading the descriptions of all the different and odd burgers they offered there. I got the BBQ burger and it was very good. (Better than the sushi in my opinion) 

The drinks are excellent! I always end up getting the spiked milkshake, it is absolutely delicious for anyone with a sweet tooth.

Service is average. However, it should be better for the amount of money that you pay to eat there.

Now for some odd reason, I was fully prepared to have my first big yelp let down here.... Maybe it was the concept that seemed so foreign, who knows? Looking back, I laugh at my initial thought process. 

Sadly, my travels often have me traveling by my lonesome, which means a lot of meals where my dining companion is the bartender. Numerous times, I've gone to restaurants where the bartender is ice cold, makes no suggestions, and offers no input on the city I'm currently in. My bartender at cowfish - Jeff M - was the polar opposite of that. Dude was straight up welcoming, friendly, offered several menu suggestions; essentially what any bar owner should be looking for in a bartender. When he learned I was from out of town, he gave me a list of several other restaurants off the beaten path. It's a pretty intense list I was given... Bfast, fried chicken, bars, etc

Anyway, the food here is wonderful. I was a little reserved on the filet mignon wrapped sushi roll but it was a flavor party in my mouth; as was the Marc's roll. I'm only in town for a few days, but I look forward to going back and trying some other menu items!

We went on a Saturday afternoon, they had a small wait but offered immediate seating on the heated patio. We opted to sit out on the patio, and it was really nice! Very comfortable and warm, which was a pleasant surprise!

Our waitress greeted us immedietly, and gave us our menus. Those menus are ridicilous! I had no idea where to start....but when in doubt...start with a cold glass of beer! I selected the Purple Haze-which was light bodied with a hint of raspberry. It was very refreshing and delicious! 

Now back to that awesome menu...I decided to try one of the amazing burgers. I chose the The Jalapeño Popper Show-Stopper- cool name right?? Well it's an even better burger! 

This burger came loaded with jalapeño-infused cream cheese, jalapeño bacon and fried jalapeños. Served on a brioche bun with jalapeño citrus aioli, lettuce, tomato and fresh sliced jalapeños. 

WOWsers!!! I chose to sub the beef patty with a veggie burger and that was an awesome desision! It was packed with several different beans, cranberries and delicious veggies! That jalepeno cream cheese was heavenly...and fried and fresh jalepenos together was a wonderful combination for the burger. It has a nice kick with each bite!

We went for lunch on April 7th, and got there around 11:45. When we walked in we were told there was a 15-30 minute wait, and we could wait at the bar if we liked. We ordered some blood mary's (which were amazing), and parked it for wait for lunch. The Cowfish fills up early and is always busy, so a wait is expected unless you get there exactly at opening.

We watched people come and go, and then noticed that people who came in after us were being seated. My lunch mate went to speak with the girl who asked us to wait at the bar, and we found that she hadn't given us a beeper. She assured us we would get the next table, and we were seated within 5 minutes.

Always get the fried pickles here - they are great! They come with a semi-hot cream dip, which I think gets its heat from Sriracha; and a ranch dip. The pickles come directly out of the fryer and are always extremely hot. Sip on your drink for a couple while they cool down.

I ordered the King's Roll, it is my favorite at Cowfish. Once again it didn't disappoint. Stuffed with tuna, kani, jalapeno, cream cheese, and scallions; it's very lightly fried and then topped with crab salad, masago, hot and cream sauces. The pieces are huge, and I've found somewhat difficult to eat with chopsticks. So yes, I look like a noob eating it with my fork...but I'm happy with my King's Roll! 

Highly recommended trying the Cowfish. If they tell you there's a wait, you can eat at the bar (first come, first served); if you prefer a table, make sure to get a beeper!  :)",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-04-15,0,review,0

My husband and I have returned a few times since my last review and each time was a great experience. The most memorable one was when we brought our out-of-town guests for dinner. We wanted to take them to a fun place with high energy and that would stand out from any other restaurant...and boy were we right!

Our guests loved the variety and the fun, yet strange options of hamburgers and fish in the same menu. They were also impressed with the language lesson in the bathroom and the touch screens at the bar. 

We ordered 5 sushi rolls to share. We had a slight issue with one of the rolls and immediately our server and owner took ownership and made sure that the one hiccup didn't ruin the rest of our dining experience. In fact, the excellent service made the night even more impressive...our guests were shocked at how caring the service was! By the way, they make their roll slices pretty big...if you want more bite-sizeable, ask for them to cut it into more pieces.

You have to make sure to get a spiked milkshake for dessert...the chocolate one (can't remember the name) was by far the best one! Yummy!!

Before moving to charlotte I asked a native for recommendations and when she said ""Cowfish"" I instantly asked ""Cow... Fish?"" assuming I had misheard.  This unique restaurant flawlessly blends land and sea in an innovative way. 

The wait time here can be completely ridiculous, with wait times constantly above an hour on weekend nights, but if you go early (before 6sih) during the week you should be fine.
The crab spring rolls are delicious and come with a great sweet and sour sauce to dip it in. If you are a sushi fan I would recommend the The Boss or Miss Moffit's Roll (obviously I am a tuna lover). If you are feeling mildly, but not completely, adventurous the bento boxes are a great compromise, where you can try the burger of the week, sweet potato fries, sushi, edamame and the thai cucumber salad. I don't care for the cucumber salad and they will double up on edamame instead if requested. If you are all in for the fusion experience, I liked the Taste Explosion Roll or the Turfin' Surfer Roll. Both those rolls were rather large and I ended up cheating and using a fork and knife.

My husband got the spicy yellow tail small roll, and we got the Parmesan truffle fries to share. 

The Parmesan fries were excellent. The burger was excellent (although I did have to ask for my bacon, but they were great and very fast getting it over).

Was in there yesterday for a late lunch, I ordered the Seared Tuna Nicoise salad and a glass of the Caymus (or was it Caymay) chardonnay. 

The chardonnay was incredible subtle hints of fruit and a creamy finish. 

Then came the food... They brought out the seared tuna appetizer... did not order that... asked one of the bartenders what this was... it was not the salad so he took it back... then the original bartender came over to apologize.. fine whatever, but could you please ask the kitchen to put the herb dressing and ginger dressing on the side. He said sure and walked back to the kitchen... 

Ok, still waiting... finally it comes out. The salad looked lovely and fresh-really beautiful. The dressing were good (not great), but what ruined my lunch was the tuna... a piece was put on my plate that you couldn't even knife through.. WTF, this is the second time... If I had put that in my mouth, I would have lost it... I am so picky about my sushi... REALLY... the first time this happened with the salmon and now the tuna... 

Ok, so Meghan, the ultra cool manager was not there, instead it was some shitty manager. I brought the cut of meat to his attention, he apologized but reluctantly. 

That really blows... he blows... do I really ever want to go back... probably not. Well at least not for the sushi... I know better than to order sushi so far from the ocean.

Since it's been over a month since they reopened without problems and I got off work a little early yesterday, I was finally able to try them out. (And avoided getting sick lol)

The burger I got was pretty tasty and very large but didn't blow me away overall. I ordered the ""Big Squeal"" which is a burger topped with smoked gouda cheese, BBQ pulled pork, bacon slaw, pickles, lettuce, onion straws, and more BBQ sauce. I ordered my burger medium, and it came out at the correct temp but wasn't super juicy and could've used a little more seasoning. The bun was a little too small for the burger and wasn't that soft; it was definitely lost beneath the big beef patty, especially after soaking up some of the juices and sauce. The BBQ pulled pork didn't have a ton of meat on top of the burger, but the sauce added a ton of flavor, almost overwhelmingly so. The bacon slaw was very vinegary but didn't add much bacon flavor unfortunately. The onion straws added a nice crunch, and the smoked gouda was great on its own but was a little overwhelmed by all the other flavors of the burger. The burger was pretty good overall, but between the BBQ sauce, slaw, and 6-7 pickles it had a strong vinegar taste, which I didn't mind but would be something to look out for. Fair warning: do not order this burger if on a first/second date, it is BIG and it is very, very messy so you may look like a fool eating it. The sweet potato fries I receive on the side were average- solid portion, crispy, and decent tasting but nothing that would blow you away. 
My server at the bar was nice, but I was a little surprised that my burger took over 20 minutes to come out once ordering considering it was fairly early and the restaurant wasn't very busy at the time. Overall the food was good but not great, service was pretty solid, and for $14 I got filled up on a huge burger, so just slightly above average for me. This place is a little funky as well with funny posters and fish tanks all around. I think that's the biggest thing going for it- you can get decent quality burgers and (I'm assuming) decent sushi at the same place, which is just a bit funky in itself.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2015-07-29,1,review,1

For appetizers we had the crab rangoon dip and the seared steak tataki. I loved the dip and my wife did too. The seared steak tataki had steak, scallops, yellowtail, and tuna that was seared on the outside and raw on the inside. Not my kinda thing, bit my wife LOVED it. 

For the entrees I had the taste explosion roll (on the advice of a  fellow Yelper) and my wife had the filet and lobster roll. We both ate until we thought we'd pop! These were great choices, but beware, her steak was again seared on the outside, rare or raw inside. That's something she loved.

David (complete with a handlebar moustache) was an EXCELLENT server. David took the time to explain things and make recommendations. All of his advice was 100% correct.

Super Clean Restaurant, One of the cleanest I've been too.  

The menu is expansive and everyone you bring will be able to find something they enjoy. 
I was told by a friend that I needed to try the Crab Rangoon dip. HOLY COW GUYS. NOTHING Compares. It is AWESOME. The chips have the red sauce on it that you normally dip Crab Rangoons. I will order this Every Time!

I didn't try the Burgushi, I got regular sushi, and it was on par with some of the best I've had.

1) I had to wait as long as I did with Clean tables in sight. NO RESERVATIONS
2) It's pretty loud, louder than I expect a sit down Restaurant to be. might have been the half price wine ;-)
3) It's Rather expensive, the Waitress said normally a person would get 2 rolls to fill them up. 2 Sushi rolls (Marks Roll and Soft Shell Crab Roll ) Cost me around 32 dollars. Great sushi, Less than Great Price.

When I sat down and looked at the menu, the most unique and bizarre items on the menu was the Burgushi where sushi ingredients came together as a burger and Western cuisine came together as a roll (Unlike Philly rolls, which are just abominations).  An odd concept nonetheless.

I came with a friend and we ordered the Spicy Togarashi Shrimp as an appetizer.  My friend ordered two of the ""Burgushi"" rolls and I ordered the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich.  The Spicy Togarashi Shrimp were deep fried shrimp covered in sweet and spicy sauce.  It was delicious and the portion was generous, but as far as taste goes, I could have probably ordered something similar from a P.F. Chang (in a non-offensive manner of speaking).

The ""Burgushi"" however is a completely different story.  Not only was my sandwich delicious, they were extremely creative using soy paper, rice, and fake crab meat to make the ""buns"" of my sandwich.  It was surprisingly large and filling yet didn't feel extremely heavy after finishing.  The rolls however can get a bit filling especially those that are topped with mayo (But then again, the ""premium"" rolls at other sushi restaurants do the same thing so you judge).

Overall, it was a very pleasant experience with friendly wait staff and good food with a very small wait time. It's a little more expensive than your typical fusion restaurant, but it's worth the premium you pay.

The gal who opened the door for me as well as the guy at the host stand were both super friendly.  I told them it was my first visit and I was looking for a great sushi roll.  They provided several recommendations, all which looked fantastic.  

My server was Leanna.  I give her a shout out because she was BEYOND nice and attentive.  A Los Angeleno could get used to this kind of southern friendliness!  

I ordered a Mark's Roll sans jalapeno.  It was delicious, ranks at the top of my all-time favorite roll list.  I didn't try anything else, but all the food around me looked fantastic.

We've been here several times, and I'm sure the waitstaff is delighted when they hear they don't have to explain the weighty menu to oldtimers.

My favorite appetizers are the crab rangoon dip (makes me drool just thinking about it), the lobster and crab spring rolls (pretty presentation!), and the avocado and ahi tuna-tini (could make this my meal all by itself).  I've created my own sushi rolls at times for an entree, but the crafted rolls on the menu are so delicious I usually just select something already created by the restaurant. One roll is enough for anyone other than perhaps sumo wrestlers... or my 15 year old.  The bento boxes are also a nice option since they offer a little bit of everything.

""Burgushi"" is the Cowfish's term for a fusion of burgers and sushi, and this is a nice thing to try if you're not really into the raw fish thing (silly you). These ""sushi"" rolls incorporate a lot of filet mignon choices and/or cooked fish, bacon(!), lamb, pulled pork, etc, etc. I've never had one I didn't love. 

The restaurant is a little loud, but it has a fun sort of industrial-vibe about it with interactive touchscreen menus at the bar and amusing, snarky paintings on the wall that will make you chuckle if you have any sense of humor at all.  There is a nice patio area in the back as well. The bar wraps around the entire restaurant and offers plenty of seating along with views of an amazing fish tank. 

The owner of this restaurant is a Texas Longhorn... Hook 'em!!!!! (though I would eat here even if he was an Aggie). I haven't tried the Cowfish's new location in Raleigh yet, but that is about to be rectified in a couple of weeks. I've given up hoping any restaurant like this will open up in Winston-Salem/Greensboro.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2013-10-14,3,review,2

The seaweed salad was good and crunchy, but share it with other people at your table if you expect to finish it off and still have room for your meal.

My girlfriend and I split our main meals; I had The Green Monster, sounded great on the menu but there was no flavor to the meat, no salt, pepper, garlic salt, nothing.  The ingredients the flavorless burger had stacked on it didn't offer anything either, I could only taste the jalapenos.  My girlfriend's choice was the Taste Explosion from their Burgushi section, lots of flavor, however very heavy and wouldn't choose it again if I was the only one eating it.

Maybe my expectations were too high.  The first time I went to Cowfish we waited an hour and half to be seated, and an additional half hour to get our meals.  That didn't bother me, it just made me think ""wow, this place has got to be awesome if people are willing to wait this long"".  I was wrong.  People are stupid.  This place is trendy so people THINK it's good.  

If you want a trendy spot with better Sushi, try Nikko.  Again, I've had better Sushi for less money, just not in Charlotte.  Their cowboy roll is better than any of the ""Burgushi"" selections I've tried at CF.

We decided to try The Cowfish after a day of shopping at Southpark.  It was a week night and wasn't too crowded - we sat on the heated patio.

Blood sugar levels were low and our eyes were bigger than our stomachs (that's always my excuse) so we ordered a couple rolls and apps.

The sweet & spicy cucumbers, the crab Rangoon dip (o.m.g). I was hooked.

We ended up getting a few items to go as well since we were headed back to Cola and wanted to enjoy more cowfish the following day.

Tab was well over $100 which was expected  - tip was over 30% because our server did an excellent job of accommodating us.

Anyway, a few days pass and we notice the debited amount was $100 more than we'd signed for... A call to the manager was immediately made, he took our info, asked when we dined in and said he'd look into it and get back to us ASAP.

One of the owners called us shortly thereafter, he was super apologetic, he reversed and updated the charge (which was all we really wanted) and offered us a free app and 2 free entrees the next time we came in.  He emailed us personally confirming his offer.

We were eager to return not only because of the free food but because of the EXCELLENT customer service.

The owners and management actually care.

The drinks were brought back within moments, the pickles followed soon after smoking hot.  As usual, I ate one too soon and burned my mouth.  When will I learn?

Granny's is a burger served on toasted rye with pimento cheese, a fried green tomato, lettuce and Duke's mayo (if you are southern, you know the importance of Duke's being the mayo on your burger).

The well-decorated restaurant offers a full menu's worth of burgers as well as a solid sushi menu with both traditional items (such as tuna rolls and single slice nigiri) but also offers the more ""fusion"" style rolls which include things like red meat, veggies and fried rolls. 

While I wanted this to be a 5-star restaurant, the service was not quite good enough to put it over the top. 

The staff while friendly, bungled a couple of our orders, and could have been a bit more attentive.

This restaurant caught my attention since I saw my two favorite words: sushi and burger. Sushi and burgers are my two favorite types of food, so I decided I had to check out this place.

I came for lunch and the place wasn't too packed. Decided to ask the bartender what to order since I didn't know what was good. He recommended the ""What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich"" so I went ahead and ordered that. One thing I noticed immediately was that they had a great selection of beer. I told the bartender I was visiting from California, and he told me to try one of the local brews that they had. I have to say combine sushi and burger was an odd combination, but my sandwich was delicious! The sandwich had seared ahi tuna, applewood bacon, jalapenos, and it was served with spring roll wrapper filled with sushi ice. My sandwich also came with a side of sweet potato fries which was cooked to perfection! The local brew the bartender recommended was also very refreshing! (Forgot the name)

If I ever go back to Charlotte, I would definitely check this place out! It has an extended menu compared to a regular burger joint. If you do not like sushi, they have salads, burgers, sandwiches, and rolls. The bartender that was serving me was ecstatic to help me out when I was troubled by the menu. He gave me a great recommendation on the beer and my sandwich.  The place seems relaxed and chilled. Besides the food, many people were there for drinks!  (Happy hour) Besides beer, they also have wine, mixed drinks, and sake, which is rare at a burger restaurant. Finally, this place is not overpriced as you expected.

Also included in my bento box was a serving of sweet potato fries which were perfectly seasoned & cooked.  The other compartments included Edamame, cucumber salad, and 3 pieces of Nigri sushi. The Nigri included Tuna, salmon, and shrimp with a small portion of pickled ginger and wasabi.   All of this deliciousness can be had for $14... well worth it in my opinion!

Everything on the burgushi menu is excellent, however I would really recommend trying the Doug's Fillet Roll.

Back then I wanted nothing to do with sushi, so I just brushed the recommendations off even though this place was said to have amazing burgers. Fast forward to the present....I've been dragged kicking and screaming to a few local sushi places, so now I enjoy eating it unlike before. One afternoon after shopping at South Park, I decide to give it a shot.

It was early afternoon, and the only seats available were on the enclosed heated patio. My daughter and I enjoyed the decor, really fun to look at. The menu is very huge! I had an idea of what I wanted to order after looking at other people's Instagram dinners. 

I couldn't restrain myself, which meant I ordered way too much food, but I loved everything. Daughter and I shared the lobster rolls which were smashing! We both had burgers and I ordered firecracker sushi. I went back and forth between eating a huge juicy burger and delicious sushi! I had no self control. My daughter just shook her head at me. I've eaten at 12 other burger places locally and this one is my favorite so far. I see why it is always packed, I can't wait to return.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2015-02-28,1,review,1

This time we were packed in around the bar, and that corner was tight.  If I were cooler, I could say that ""tight"" meant that it was happening, or whatever tight means these days when the hip kids say it.  But tight in this case really meant tight because there were so many people jammed into such a small space - throw in everyone trying to get to their seats and the servers trying to get to them and it was off-the-hook tight.

Overall the mood was hopping, though, and the staff at the Cowfish really kept things jumping, with plate after plate (after plate after plate) of their signature sushi coming out to whet our appetites.  This is not your typical Chinese buffet sushi - this is some fancy stuff, and it did not disappoint.  I am not a sushi expert by any means, and I actually quite enjoyed it, my favorite was probably the burgers tho.

I guess that means I preferred the front end (the cow) to the back end (the fish) if I had to choose, but it was actually all tasty.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2011-03-20,4,review,0

So, I can easily see that if you're just a sorta sushi fan, then you're going to love Cowfish because you can throw it in your sushi-eating friends' faces and say you eat sushi, too!  Burger sushi!

It is a very fun atmosphere.  The waitstaff is very friendly.  Good music.  Even a cute graphic display to show your wait for your table (look for the big video monitor showing the swimming fish).  They even use your cell phone to text you.

As a beef eater, I'd say the food is pretty good.  It's not Ruth Chris, but it's a fusion between beef and sushi, so I did try the Taste Temptation, which is beef, tomatoes and rice, and found it decent.  Of all the things I had, they did have a really good crab and lobster shrimp roll for an appetizer.  Quite big and very tasty.

I'm not a diner that enjoys kitsch - I don't like cutesy-wootsy ambiance or clever decor. I just want a great meal in a clean establishment. It was our anniversary and so even though we have a fabulous more reasonable (and better) sushi place we made the hike to South Park to try The Cowfish. Why not do something special?

The meal was okay. The service was excellent considering the place was packed. I didn't really like the menu - it was way too big like almost as large as The Cheesecake Factory. I thought the food was uninspired - too many sauces and dips and crazy complicated dishes that almost always seem to mask ingredients that aren't that fresh. The menu reflected a lack of focus - what was this place - was it a burger joint or a sushi place? I found it mildly irritating. We had the crab rangoon dip and a fusion bento box for each of us. When our bento boxes were brought out the first thing I said was they could have at least given us two sliders.  

The food was good but not fantastic and definitely not worth the 58 dollars we paid for lunch. 

I recommend this place for people who want to eat sushi but everyone else in your party wants a burger.

That's the problem with either not having time to wait or being starved and needing to go somewhere else less busy.

Anyway, I had planned to be at the restaurant shortly after they open on a Saturday morning and that proved to be a good idea, as they were packed and a lineup for tables had formed by the time that we left.  

The wife and I split a seaweed salad, a bison burger and a couple of sushi rolls.  The menu here is huge with all the options for sushi, burgers and everything in between.  The burger had some nice chipotle heat to it and was very enjoyable.  The sushi rolls were huge and were ""fusion"" rolls called tropical storm and the south park roll.  They were basically sushi rolls with layers of sashimi on the outside.  All the ingredients were fresh and had great flavors including the smoked salmon, tuna and yellow tail.

The service really blew me away here, as our server was very energetic and explained the menu thoroughly and expertly.  Overall, it was a great first experience for me at Cowfish.

3072227,1,7bwh6A4cl8DqZV44kAjWjA,n_o2XcnV42q8kTJ9eB0TMw,"Delicious, charming, and chic. 

This yelp review is based off the Yelpy Hour that Cowfish so graciously hosted. Lemme tell ya, you need to call ahead for seats, at least on a Thursday night. This place was PACKED. 35 minutes for a table. Good thing us Yelpers had a reserved section. 

Plate after plate of different, yummy food was brought out, so I got to have the sushi, burger, and extras. 

Sushi: To DIE for. They had such interesting fusion! Normally I like to go traditional, but I'm glad I got to try these new favorites. I can't really identify any of the roles that I ate for free besides the obvious salmon or tuna laying across the top, but they were all great. We actually decided to stay for dinner after, it was so good. We ended up getting the Tuna Nachos, and the Motherload. 

Those tuna nachos... damn. They make my mouth water just thinking about them. Very large, flat nacho with rich, creamy crab rangoon dip spread over it, some greens and spices on top of that, and then tuna sashimi on top. So, so good. The only thing is that the seasoning on the Tuna (which almost tasted like ginger), while good on the tuna, seemed to clash with the rest of the crab rangoon/chip ensemble. That wasn't a problem for me, since I merely ate the sashimi first, then delved into the chip. 
The Motherload is a $23 sushi platter that has all the fish on the menu. When we ordered it, the waiter assured me that this was not for sushi beginners, and we might see some stuff we hadn't previously discovered. I love your deeper, untraditional Americanan sushi, and was excited. However upon receiving the order, it was pretty much all normal stuff on there. Delicious yes, but normal. Delicious rolls with white fish, tuna, salmon, and fillet, topped with flying fish roe. The sashimi consisted of a few slices of octopus, a very large sweet shrim (my favorite), and sliced scallop (second favorite). The scallop was topped with salmon roe. There was also a tempura-fried prawn in a spring roll with peanut dipping sauce, which I am glad to say, also came with the head on the plate (gotta love sucking out those prawn brains! ... I may have scarred my dinner partner for life in doing so, though.). All in all delicious, but I think pretty standard sushi fare.

Burgers:
I don't know what they were. Little sliders that were flavorful, covered in sauces and condiments, different veggies, and were very juicy. Delicious. 

Extras:
Fried pickles: they were there. They are what they are: good, but nothing to write home about.
Chicken skewers: platter of very flavorful and moist marinated chicken. Not a huge chicken onna stick person if there's sushi around to be had, but these were great little noms. 
Edamame: Lightly salted, gently steamed, and delicious

Drinks: 
My vodka collins was always refilled, and though not extremely flavorful, very strong. 
Got to try some 'carbonated' sake. Usually a stickler for traditional warmed plum, this was actually pretty good, very fruity. Glad I got to try it.

This turned out to be a treat that helped take our dining experience to another level. 
Our waitress was Caroline and while I wouldn't have thought it on first impression, she turned out to be an awesome waitress. Attentive, informative, and able to roll with my quirky humor. With Caroline's help we were able to navigate the extensive menu and settled on the crab Rangoon dip appetizer along with the Turfin Surfer Roll and an amazing roll we were able to put together from their ""Make your own"" roll part of the menu.

Anyways, started with shishito peppers and spicy poke dip.  Both were great, and when we ran out of the wonton chips, the waiter brought us some more.

For dinner I had the Thundering Herd Bison Burger and my gf the Honey, Brie Mine.  Both were also very well done and I thought the combination of toppings was well proportioned so I did not end up with any flavor that over powered the others.

Everything looks wonderful on the menu, and some things look truly interesting, but they arrive pretty but lacking. Costwise it's not at all out of line, if it were well executed, and you get a surprising amount of food when it arrives (which unfortunately isn't a good thing when the food isn't great). 

I split the lamb sushi roll with my tablemate and it was the best part of the meal, though the tzatziki was bland. With a bit of tweaking (stronger flavor and fresh herbs) could have made that dish spectacular instead of just good. The lamb itself was well seasoned and the other ingredients worked well with it. 

My main meal was the 'ultimate bento' in hopes of getting a sampling of what the food could be, but it wasn't so ultimate. It had clearly been sitting around waiting for a while (it took forever to get it) which did the food no favors, but it was poorly executed to begin with. The sushi roll was soggy (probably from the time sitting), which made for a miserable experience since fried calamari had been in the equation. The calamari ended up a soggy mess in the middle of the roll. The slider was very poorly cooked (one patty was cooked to death and may have even bounced if dropped, while the other was medium and actually spot on), the pimento cheese that was supposed to be on it literally was a smaller dab than my fingernail, and there was just a single soggy shaved pepper on it. The sweet potato fries were no better than what you'd experience in a cheap restaurant, which was also unfortunate since I really like sweet potato fries, but the sitting I'm sure had a lot to do with that as well. The cucumber salad was good, though realistically it couldn't have ever made up for the rest of it.

Overall I'd say save your money. Spend it somewhere where the execution lives up to the description on the menu.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,2,2013-04-28,0,review,0

We then split three rolls (Miss Moffitt, Marks Roll and Tropical Storm) The fusion sushi rolls are expensive, but keep in mind they are entree size. Each one was better than the next.

Tried the Doug's roll which is burgushi - excellent and something very new for me. 

The Boss was also tasty- albeit a little pricey at $19 ( but expected for a higher quality sushi...not your take-out Japanese joint). I particularly liked the ponzu with this. The presentation was beautiful - fresh flowers and everything.  

My absolute favorite was the tuna nachos - not your typical nacho but I would come back for this alone.

We started off with signature cocktails; Skinny Gonzales, Moscow Muleshine, and Buleits & Bacon. Wow! They were delicious and strong.

Or, put your name on the list and walk somewhere else to have a cocktail or shop while you wait. They do not take reservations. 

Specials: 
Mondays- 1/2 price cocktails
Tuesdays- 1/2 price martinis
Wednesday- 1/2 price bottles of wine
Thursday- 1/2 price sake

I love to order the fusion specialty bento box. I go with whatever the slider of the day is. The sides are delicious. My favorite is the cucumber salad.

Apps: do you like crab rangoon? ORDER THE CRAB RANGOON DIP. It's a deconstructed crab rangoon and it's delicious. It's worth noting again... the fried pickles are damn good.

Trendy restaurant/bar with eccentric decorations, the sushi bar includes built in touch-screen computers with games and other apps--including a button for calling the waiter or a drink menu where you can touch-to-order your next drink.

DELICIOUS and creative burgers, you have to try them all! The sweet potato fries are heavenly, and of course--my favorite--you MUST try the Avocado Spring Rolls--the best appetizer they brought from Eez.

Lunch? Quick and inexpensive, they have a lunch menu which includes plates that have a slider and a sushi roll, served with your choice of sides and extras like edamame and salad.

You can't go wrong with any burger--but I recommend the pimento cheese burger... and get some of those fried jalapenos on the side along with those sweet potato fries. And don't forget your sushi, my favorite? The tropical storm--the classic rainbow roll gets an Eez makeover with beautiful presentation and HUGE flavor. You won't believe your eyes (or your tastebuds). Want an upgrade? Ask for the ""Hurricane.' You. Will. Not. Be. Disappointed.

The wait was less than 15 minutes which was very impressive since the place was packed. This gave me the impression that service was fast, but that's not the case (more on that later).

We started off with the crab rangoon dip appetizer which took about 20 minutes to come out. It came out hot, fresh, and wonderfully tasty. We decided to try burgers since we aren't big sushi fans. I had the boursin burger. The burger itself had a great flavor and the meat was sinfully tasty. It came on an onion roll which was very fresh and soft. It came loaded with delicious grilled mushrooms and onions. Here are two things that really downgraded the food. 1) the boursin cheese on the burger was horrendous and gritty and 2) it took almost 45 minutes to get our entrees. I sent the burger back and tried it with swiss and it was much better.  But the remake took 25 minutes to come out so I took it to go. I also had a side salad with ginger dressing. The dressing was the best I've had in a while.

If they could speed up service this would be one of the best restaurants around.  But it took us over 2 hours from the time we were seated to complete our meal. That's a bit excessive.  However, the food was very good.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2013-11-17,0,review,0

I can't stand over cooked tuna! Which paired well with the crisp bacon. The flavor of the ingredients and textures complemented each other well. It was surprisingly entertaining to eat. I deem it crave-worthy! It comes with a side, we opted for sweet potato fries. Some of the best I've ever had! The rainbow roll was solid.

3072909,1,C3wJYcNbb1aA1upSAOdBeA,fWdzKIUo2zMxejzyUE2_tA,"Def a really unique concept for a restaurant.  The menu is pretty expansive.  We went for lunch and there was a 45 minute wait!  It's so close to South Park Mall I feel it's probably rare that they are not on a wait on a Saturday or Sunday.  The menu offers such a wide variety of things from sushi, bento box combos, to hamburgers and shakes.  I love a good sushi roll, so I generally don't stray from that side of the menu.  My fiance had the turkey burger.  Amazing.  It was a typical burger with a goat cheese and sun-dried tomato toppings with micro greens that really set it apart.  He chose the sweet and spicy cucumbers as his side and they did not disappoint either.  I went with the Doug's filet roll.  It is topped with a seared rare filet and stuffed with crab, avocado, and cream cheese.  It was just ok.  I was hoping for something a little more wow, but it was a good roll.  (Different than your typical sushi).  They have a lamb roll and a bbq roll that I am dying to try, so I will be returning for sure.  

The only con to this place is the crowds.  It is good and large, so the wait tends to move a little quicker, but the waiting area isn't conducive for large crowds (luckily the bar has lots of room).  I love the concept of this place and the menu for its sheer difference to the rest of the restaurants in South Park.  If you're going to go here, don't eat for the day so you can try a bunch of different things!  There is too much to choose from in just one meal!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-03-02,2,review,2

The service here is top notch in my opinion, especially from the beautiful humans working behind the bar.

From the Warhol inspired Godzilla painting to the burger ""king"" who I always found creepy; the decor is contemporary, atmosphere is live, and service is fabulous. Our waiter, Walter is a master of his trade. 

Prices are surprisingly affordable and if the name wasn't a dead give away - yep this place also has an eclectic menu. From the Burger bento box, to filet oscar roll to the Arnold Hamandegger burgah. It's all good in the hood. Fish is fresh with some traditional, some make your own and the ever so present specialty rolls. 

One point I must touch on is when the server brought out our food, she asked if we wanted anything else? I happily obliged and she had no qualms when I put in an order with her rather then our waiter. 

When we let our waiter know it was our first visit , he had the manager come out to introduce himself, greet us, and offered a free appetizer for the next visit. 

He was either: 

1. Very personable, takes pride in the business, and delivering a great experience

or 

2. Recognized my pretty lil' face from Yelp and wanted to bribe me ;)

The fusion dishes are one of a kind. I even saw a bento box served with sushi rolls and beef sliders - that rocks. 

You no longer have to worry about where to go the next time your in the mood for sushi and your friend doesn't eat raw fish. This is the place. 

Be prepared for a wait it was freakin packed last night. I sampled a pimento cheese slider and a very strange sushi with pesto, mozzarella and some other stuff. The burger was delicious - but this particular sushi was a little strange for me but unique I give them that. 

I decided I was still hungry and with the crazy selection on the menu I just had to try a few more things. Ahi Tuna Nachos oh my gosh yes I will be coming back for these on a regular basis this appetizer was huge and.could definitely be a meal. Crab rangoon dip on top of wonton chips with guacamole and blackened rare ahi tuna come on people this was heaven.

We always start off with edamame, which can be prepared with 4 different flavorings, (e.g., cajun, sea salt, etc.).  I used to always get the seared sesame tuna salad which is served over a seaweed and cucumber salad with sesame seeds and sriracha (love) but lately I've been getting the tuna nicoise salad, which is huge and has a lot of tuna.  For other apps, the blackened ahi tuna nachos and avacado and tuna tini are also great.  

For sushi, I love the southpark roll but I usually do the ""make your own roll"" - you can use cucumber as the outer roll if you don't like the seaweed wrap or want to go healthy and avoid rice.  

John, the manager, is such a quality guy and always has taken good care of us.  Our kids love it here as much as we do; they usually get the bento boxes, which have a ton of food so if you want some fries/sweet potato fries, you can just eat your kid's because they'll never eat them all.

Was disappointed to find out that the salmon and tuna were cooked, but still a good dish, just not what I was expecting.  Topped off my lunch with a smores milkshake.  YUM.

I've only been here for lunch and heard it's crazy town for dinner.  If you can get a chance to stop by on a weekday for lunch, probably the best time to enjoy the menu without the long wait.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2013-01-16,2,review,1

I had some coworkers that went just about every week for the $5 martinis on Tuesdays or the half-off wine on Wednesdays so I finally decided to try it for myself. The bf and I went on a Friday night, a little after 8 - the place was PACKED. We were told it would be a hour and a half/forty five minute wait but the seating around the bar and sushi bar was first come first serve, so we hovered around that area like hyenas on the prowl and less than 10 minutes later 2 stools opened up. I ordered the crab and lobster spring rolls, they were pretty good. I like that they have a build-your-own sushi roll feature on the menu, I've never seen that anywhere else before. Not actually ""build you own"" as in you make it, but you choose whatever you want. My bf ordered a burger and fries and a milkshake. Overall, the food was about an 8, and I would come back here just because it's a unique, different experience, but it's not anything I just gotta have.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-01-09,0,review,0

I have had their binto boxes which I love when I can't decide if I want a burger or Sushi. My favorite so far is the  ""Mary Had A Little Lamb-urgushi Roll"" It's a perfect combination of natural ground seasoned lamb, kalamata olives, capers, feta cheese, red onions and spring mix rolled hosomaki style with soy paper and rice. Each piece is topped with tzatziki sauce, diced tomato, English cucumber, fried capers and fresh chopped mint. Simple Amazing.

They have one of the longest greetings due to the lengthy menu and make sure you know what they're all about. I personally would not be able to do the speech they have without stopping for a water break! 

We came in last night tried to call ahead and get a reservation but they had stopped taking them at the time and said they were not on a wait at that time and to head on in. So we had planned that if it was crazy busy and a long wait we would just go somewhere else in the area. Lucky for us we got right in and sat on the patio! 

Kevin had recommended the Ahi tuna Nachos to start so we did....they were kinda whatever, bland, Tuna was not very good and they stuck plain (not dressed) micro-greens on top a huge pet-peeve of mine! We then ordered the rest of our meal I started with the spinach salad with a warm bacon vinaigrette it was ok. They then shortly (1min later) followed it up with our entrees :(  I had the Shroom Burger with grilled onions on a brioche roll...was ok. the Shrooms had a very strange taste to them just different. I did however trust Kevin again and ordered them with the Sweet Potato fries and they were excellent just as Kevin said they'd be!! I tried my sisters (Tracy D.) Sushi Roll Mango something that was good. My BF had the Bento Box, again just ok.

So I would say we had an OK meal nothing special and nothing that really makes me want to go back either. Kevin said they are the hottest restaurant in Charlotte right now...but are they??",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2011-03-14,3,review,1

1) Great service with a nice mix of friendliness, enthusiasm and food knowledge 
2) The color red. Red makes people excited and hungry. I like the mind games you play on me Cowfish. 
3) They offer Bento boxes for a reasonable price. Don't know if you want a burger or sushi and not completely cold on the burgushi idea? Get the Bento! Comes with the burger of the week, choice of limited selection of sushi rolls, edamame, sweet potato fries and cucumber salad 
4) Fabu drink specials. All sake is half off on Thursdays---including the sake sample which was only $6 for five varieties. 
5) They put goat cheese on their burgers. Goat cheese = love. 
6) Interesting sushi combinations that will please any sushi lover out there 
7) Two words-spiked shakes 
8) Getting a spiked shake for free when they made one too many 
9) Sign up for their email list and you get a free appetizer coupon along with other special offers 
10) The vibe and the artwork....modern/pop culture/comic

3072954,4,HT7T6OaKuJHU35j9u0LUDA,7HuFO7RU47EqsDwSaFXkog,"Once upon a time, there was an amazing burger place right outside of SouthPark Mall: The Counter. This place was amazing, and when it closed I was devastated. Once it was replaced with The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar, my grief quickly went away. The Cowfish is absolutely amazing. It's owned by the same people who own eeZ in Birkdale, and having dined there, I knew the food would be delicious &amp; inventive, and I was absolutely right. But then again, I'm always right =)

The Cowfish has the traditional style rolls (Philly, rainbow, etc) and a huge list of wildly inventive &amp; exotic rolls to choose from as well. When Graham &amp; I visited the day after Christmas, I wanted to try something different than I had ordered on previous visits. We decided on three (although I wanted about ten...), one from each section: the rainbow (a traditional roll), the blackened tuna (a more unique/fusion style roll) &amp; the Doug's Filet Roll (burgushi).

I'll start with the burgushi, because it's what makes The Cowfish stand out above other sushi restaurants (and Charlotte has a TON of them!). Burgushi is taking the elements of a burger and making it into a sushi roll, or taking the elements of a sushi roll and making it into a burger/sandwich.

This was amazing. It was a Philly roll, topped with a piece of seared filet mignon, spicy sauce, scallions & masago. Absolutely amazing. I could even look past the blob of cream cheese (which I HATE in sushi). The roll was enormous, but everything about it was perfect, I really loved the spicy sauce and the very mild flavor of the filet. This is definitely my favorite item on the ""burgushi"" part of the menu, so far. 

The Rainbow Roll was, of course, my favorite. It was a California roll topped with assorted fish & spicy sauce. The fish was fresh & firm, the sauce was nice & didn't overpower the roll. I absolutely hate it when there is so much sauce you can't really taste anything else. I would have been more than happy to eat this all day. 

The last roll we had was the blackened tuna: Lump crabcake mix & cream cheese inside, rolled in temoura flakes, topped with blackened tuna, guacamole & a slice of jalepeno. 

While this roll was good, it didn't compare to the other two. The roll tasted dry & the slice of jalapeno was completely overpowering. However, the guacamole was a nice touch and absolutely delicious. I removed the jalapeno and added a different kind of heat with a little srirachia. It was a better flavor combination, in my opinion and I enjoyed the remaining pieces a lot more with this change. 

Not only was the food excellent during our lunch time visit, but the service was excellent as well. Our server took the time to go over every single aspect of the menu, and gave us a recommendation out of each category. The Filet Roll was one of her suggestions, and I'm so glad we went with that. 

My ONLY complaint here is that they are always busy, and they only take reservations from 11:00-6:00, which makes zero sense to me. Especially since most of the shops in the area (excluding the mall), close at 6:00 or 7:00. Lunch patrons can browse & shop while waiting for a table. Dinner patrons can not. I had wanted to eat here for our anniversary, but knew we would have to either wait forever or eat at the bar, so we changed our plans. We still had to wait, but 15 minutes isn't too bad in the grand scheme of things. Last time I went was on a Thursday night, and the wait was much, much longer so we ended up dining at the bar. Fine for a dinner with a friend, not as okay for an anniversary dinner with your husband.

My date and I went on a Thursday evening so I knew it would be busy (I called ahead and they didn't have any reservations) so I braced my company for a 15-30 mins wait on a table and we waited on the bench outside with a pager. We waited about a good 40 mins and other than the hostess asking if we wanted to sit at the bar (which we turned down) our pager never went off although we saw several groups of folks leaving so we finally just went inside again and of course it turns out there was space now and the pager was had didn't alert us :-( but once we finally got seated things started picking up. We had new waiter being helped by a veteran serving us and she gave a pretty long spill to cover the menu (which is pretty vast) took us a few minutes to digest it all which gave us time to enjoy our martinis and the ambience. I was torn between the Aronald Hamegger & the La Rose Sushi Roll  (ended up going with the latter) which was a shrimp based fusion.  My date went with the four play roll (oyster/salmon combo  fusion roll)  both 8 piece sets.
We both tried each other's choice and they were both phenomenal, some of the best sushi I've ever consumed in my life, hands down!

This place was soooo good. It's expensive, mind you, but the quality honestly begets the price. Some of the most unique and cool burgers I've ever seen. The sushi was damn good, and the ""burgushi"" were just amazing. It tasted like a little bit of everything at different times in its consumption. As it was, I got a burger, one friend got sushi, and another got burgushi, so we could try a little bit of everything. No one regretted their decision. My burger was really big, juicy, and 100% delicious. So they've got that down.

Also, there's so friggin' much on the menu to try, that if you had the money to come back time and again, you could always try something new. The menu is huge and the staff helped us navigate through it, make recommendations, etc. It was almost daunting in its size, which isn't something that happens often, I don't think.

There is no restaurant that serves food quite like this. Go for the uniqueness alone, and leave wholly satisfied by the strange, exotic, and wholly awesome food combinations you just ate.

But, uh, leave with a little bit of a hole burned in your wallet too. ;) However much it may be worth it.

The place was packed when we arrived, so we took our pager and wandered around outside until a table cleared up. In addition to the pager, they ask for your phone number. They'll bombard you with annoying texts as you wait. Lesson learned.

The wait wasn't bad, and we were seated in their covered patio/leper colony area. The walk there was treacherous; the floor inside the place was all oily and slippery. After making it to our seats in one piece, we were promptly greeted by our server, who was very thorough in her explanations and attentive in her service. 

There's a great selection of beverages, from hand-spun shakes to beer and sake. Two people in my party ordered the hot ginger tea and were impressed. I stuck to beer, and the last in our group ordered a sake sampler. All of the beverages were good.

We started off with some edamame. Paying $6 for a frozen steam-in-bag pile of edamame irked me a bit and set the tone for many of the menu items: they're way overpriced for what they are. For entrees, we ordered a variety of things, including a burgushi roll (Doug's roll), a burgushi bento box, a roll/sashimi combo, and a sushi roll. I enjoyed my Doug's roll, which was flavorful and really unique. It was not worth the price. The other menu items were fair at best. The rolls fell apart easily because of poorly cooked rice.

Our server, Chris, was excellent.  He knew a lot about the menu and really helped my guest figure out a way to get/try everything she wanted to for the best price. He was polite and on point with everything. 

I ordered the half portion of the Parmesan truffle fries because the app size is massive.  These things are to die for. I mean...once of the most yummy things I've had in a long time.  The Deliverance Roll here is just like the ""High Class Hillbilly"" Roll in Orlando. It was just as I remembered. The BBQ was so moist and flavorful, the bacon infused coleslaw was amazing, and the crispy potato straws on top added a nice crunch. Love love love.

I finished off the meal with a Rice Krispy Treat milkshake that really hit the spot.  Good on you, Cowfish!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2016-02-20,2,review,1

One thing that I thought that was funny and annoying at he same time was the restroom would play a CD of random quotes from different languages. its pretty funny.  Ok off of my side note now on to the food. 

1. Sushi:  AMAZING..  However I feel they need to have more traditional sushi not this americanized CRSP with jalapenos and cream cheese its gross to be honest but whatever to each their own right?

On the other hand, I hate paying the upscale price for food when I don't have to.  This is one of those upscale places where the food costs more than I prefer but apparently I paid for the quality I received.

The sushi roll I had was pretty good and filling.  I can't remember what I ordered but I know it was near that bottom of the menu and with tax, it cost me $18.40 or so.  I can say the roll was so big, it was easier to mix my wasabi and soy sauce in the dish and pour it on my roll than to dip my roll in the wasabi and soy sauce mixture.  I figured I'd need to stop elsewhere afterwards to get some more food because of the price but once the roll was consumed, I was satisfied and full.

Here is the food breakdown:

1) Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos- There is a dash of the crab rangoon dip here so you don't have to order the Crab Rangoon appetizer (supposedly portioned for larger tables per our waitress).  I was not a huge fan on the tuna, but my boyfriend inhaled it pretty fast.

2) The Hunka burger- LOVE the combination!  Who would have thought peanut butter, bananas, and bacon could make magic like this?!  Seems like the bacon really pulls everything together.  The portion is fairly large and we only ordered it with one Hunka.  Maybe you can double dare me to do the Hunka Hunka next time.

3) Cowfish Bento Box- this one is a little more fluff than meat.  You get generous portions of sweet potato fries, cucumber salad, and edamame.  The mini cheeseburger is truly mini and the sushi portion is small as well.  Nevertheless, the plate is filling and definitely worth trying for newbies.

4) Magnificent Mango Martini- Tuesdays are $5 martini nights and they sure do know how to mix you a good one here!  This one is more sweet vs. strong and definitely worth trying!

The burgushi was FANTASTIC, and I chose the seaweed salad for my side (huge portion, yay!), which is one of my favorite things on the planet. My husband devoured the electric eel roll, which he pronounced spectacular -- and it was gorgeously plated. The dynamite roll was good...the sushi pieces are a little bigger than I prefer (practically impossible to eat without cutting in half).

To say that this place is popular is an understatement. Four of us arrived for an early dinner before taking a friend to the airport and the place was packed. When we left the restaurant it was the more traditional dinner hours and there were tons of people waiting at the bar and outside for a table. 

The idea of a sushi and burger fusion restaurant is very unique and allows the menu to suit the needs of many different tastes. The menu is large there are both traditional and japanese appetizers and entrees. The Cowfish also has some interesting drink offerings including a wide array of alcoholic milkshakes. Our table ordered several hard milkshakes and an additional cocktail. Everyone was pleased with the drinks. For an appetizer we had the edamame flight which features four different seasonings (Sea Salt, Wasabi Ranch, Cajun Sriracha and Sesame Salt). The table loved the Sriracha but they were all very tasty. We also had a seaweed salad which was fantastic. For entrees, two people order the Cowfish bento box which features a mini slider burger, sushi, sweet potato fries, sweet and spicy cucumbers, and edamame. The bento box was good. You get to pick the sushi style and although not the best sushi I have ever had it was very flavorful and well rolled. The other people at the table got a sushi roll and a build your own sushi. They also enjoyed the sushi platters. Overall, it isn't the best sushi on the planet but it is good. 

In closing, the food is good, the service was alright, and the environment is trendy. The place is trying to do something different and I cannot fault them for that. This is a place that you will be happy you tried since it is so different. Like some other reviewers, there were some ordering mixups and some food didn't arrive or was delayed.

Remember if you are going to Cowfish to expect a long wait and if you cannot accept that than go early or choose somewhere different. The wait is well worth the delicious food and drinks offered. I ordered a Manhattan from the bar as we waited and this drink was definitely worthy of the cost. It was a very deliciously concocted and as per Manhattan the Maker's Mark was not weak. 

To start dinner we ordered the crab rangoon dip which was amazing. In hindsight we did not need to order this app but it was delicious nonetheless. We the ordered a sushi roll each. Having eaten at Eez we knew that the rolls here are huge but once again little did we know one of the plates was massive! We ordered The Motherload which would have been perfect for my boyfriend and I to share. It had so much fish and was definitely a great value.

Actually, HONESTLY, I walked out of there thinking I got one hell of a deal. The food was ROCKIN! The service was too. 

We tried some of everything being as we are from out of town and the menu was just too incredible and outrageous to pick one thing to eat... 

You definitely need reservations, and don't hesitate to look at other peoples food as you are walking in - The presentations were tip-top, as was ours when the food was served. 

You don't like sushi? There is plenty of traditional choices that looked out of this world... Want to ""hang"" with the sushi crowd but not eat fish? Get some filet and portabella wrapped in a roll - you make the rules.  

Bottom line - You'll leave impressed and craving more.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2011-07-14,3,review,1

3073021,0,cuVrNmt7_WtBn1uz5L_p0g,ZFFutYy8r7IC34asAaiVHg,"Put simply, it may be the case that the Cowfish is overrated. Located next to the shopping mall underneath an apartment building (I do not want to be associated with people who live in apartments basically on top of a mall. Ick.), the Cowfish restaurant seems wildly popular. It has nearly 500 reviews in the solid red-orange range of four stars. My wife and I couldn't get a table at 4:30 on Jan. 1, so we sat at the bar.

Here you can get sushi, or burgers, or a combo of both. I guess this means your health nut friends and your obese unhealthy friends can all get together in one restaurant! For that, Cowfish, many kudos. In fact, more restaurants should be heading in this direction. And for that, you deserve four stars. Below is why I knocked it down a notch.

Step inside the bathroom and you hear automated recordings of a man and a woman taking on a faux North Carolina hick, redneck accent and spewing off a number of homespun axioms. I wish I could remember a few, but they were things like, ""Don't pee on my back and call it rain!"" and they were repeated ad nauseam. It was truly difficult to bear. The next reason Cowfish drops a notch is simply due to its service. It took forever to get a food order, and when we did, the food arrived fairly quickly. I ordered some edamame and sushi. The edamame was good, and not too salty. The sushi was also good: spicy tuna and vegetarian rolls. They were wrapped pretty well, you got a good piece of fish in there, and it tasted fresh.

On the walls are the paintings that are humorous take-offs on famous paintings or art. Some seem mildly offensive or distasteful. One of them is an Asian Mona Lisa. What? Another is a rendering of Picasso's Guernica, which depicts the German bombing of a Basque region during the Spanish Civil War. It's a pretty gut-wrenching painting of a solemn topic. But in the Cowfish's rendering, all the character, people suffering and fleeing from a Nazi bombing, are COWS. It's just not in good taste. Granted, some of the painting are actually funny.

To top it of, after I paid, my server started awkwardly joking with me as I fiddled with my phone. ""I know you want to dance,"" he quipped to the loud pop music pumping in the background. It's okay. Go ahead and dance."" Where was all this attention when I wanted to order a meal? I managed a polite, if feeble, grin, and got the heck outta there.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2014-01-02,0,review,0

It was our first time and made the mistake of telling waitress we would take ""first available"" seating. We thought it was a table vs a seat at the bar.
Well it was that plus a third choice, sitting outside on the patio in 90 degree heat with 90 percent humidity. The glasses of water on the table were sweating so much there were puddles under them.  It was uncomfortable to say the least.

Anyway the food, 
I ordered a Tropical Storm Roll (sushi)
The menu describes it as:
California roll topped with 3 layers of fresh sashimi (tuna, salmon and yellowtail), then topped with Japanese cream sauce, sweet brown sauce and sriracha. Each pieces is then covered with multi-colored tobiko (flying fish egg) for a fantastic presentation. Served with a side of wasabi yuzu dipping sauce

Even though I read the description, I underestimated this roll.
When they say three layers of fish they mean it. The pieces of sushi were so large with the fish on top you had to deconstruct each slice because no human (a snake maybe) could get their mouth opened to fit a piece of this roll. Which was super flavorful.  There was no sign of sriracha sauce but plenty on the table so I added my own. 

Upon walking in the door we were quoted 45 mins for a table and I would have walked out by my daughter had her heart set on this place. Good news was that the wait was closer to 15-20 mins. Hostess probably lost a lot of business with those bad estimates, but hey it got me seated faster!

We arrived around 1:00pm on a Friday and we had to wait roughly ten minutes for a table for six.  We were seated and handed our menus.  As has been previously noted, these menus are books.  You should allow yourself ten minutes just to read through the menu, as there is a lot to take in.  Our waitress came by to introduce herself and take our drink orders.  She asked if we had been to the restaurant before and when we replied that we hadn't, she walked us through the major sections of the menu.

Our drinks were brought out (including a quart glass milk-style bottle for water refills) and we placed our orders.  It was no more than fifteen minutes when all our plates were brought out.  I can only speak for the burger, but the CBCLT was quite good.  Served on a brioche bun (other bread options are available) with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and two types of cheddar, this is a solid burger.  The beef is all-natural, grass-fed which is something that I look for when I eat beef.  I had requested my burger be cooked medium, and for the most part it was.  The sweet potato fries on the side were tasty, but maybe just a tad above average.  The burger was served with their Cowfish Sauce, which I didn't quite care for.  But I loved that they had Sriracha Sauce in the lazy susan on the table.  Mixed some of that with some ketchup and had a spicy dip for my fries.  Good times.

This restaurant has a great vibe and a really eclectic burgers and sushi menu.  Prices may be a teensy bit high, but I think the food is worth it every once in a while.  Service was top-notch and personal.  And the men's bathroom had a scented candle!  Be sure to check out the book prints in the hallway on your way to the restroom.

As far as entrees, we got mark's Roll, the volcanic rolls, and a few others.  They were rather large as the waitress has told us (I even ended up taking some home... and I NEVER have leftover sushi lol).  They tasted really good, but the volcanic and mark's roll were my favorites out of what we had.  

All in all, it was an excellent experience!! Another thing that contributed to my rating was the attitude of the staff.  They were all very helpful, and available (which is a big deal with me).  Even the manager Kevin came over, and it wasnt the normal ""how was your meal?"" And then off to the next table.  He actually took the time to ask us about details of our experience,  made some recommendations for our next visit, thanked us for trying it for the first time, asked about our service, and really seemed to care about every aspect of our dining experience.  It really takes a lot to impress me with service, and this really stuck out to me.  So i am glad that I tried it, and will definitely recommend to anyone visitng Charlotte!!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2015-09-20,0,review,0

My wife and I went on a Friday night. We had been talking about going there for awhile and with the wait being a little long we took two seats at the bar. The food was fantastic, the bartenders were great and even with all the people fluttering all around we had a really good time. 

The next day my mother-in-law, sister-in-law and nephew (all of whom I love) came to visit and on the Saturday we took them to Cowfish as we knew our nephew would love it. We had a great time, great food and the kicker for him was the language lessons in the bathrooms where they teach you to say certain phrases in English, Spanish and Redneck! He was thrilled. 

Well the next day we were looking for a place to go and here's the part where it might not have turned out so great, with a choice for lunch in all of Charlotte our nephew picked Cowfish again! (I think the fried pickles and the language lessons were a big draw) Anyway it was still great and I can highly recommend it to everyone especially now with the fountain on and the live music on weekend nights.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2011-06-05,0,review,0

Tried it a couple of years ago and hated it but since they have raving reviews, we decided to give it another chance last week because I was craving sushi. 
First of all their menu is way too overwhelming. Its so much stuff on there that it takes forever to go through the whole menu. 
Their sushi is more on the modern Americanized side rather than Japanese style sushi. I ordered a roll and a Yellow tail hand roll and my oh my, the yellow tail in the hand roll was sooooo thickly cut that I could not even bite it apart with my teeth. yuck. Sashimi is NOT supposed to be cut so thick as where you can not bite it in one bite more so not be able to cut it with your teeth. 
It was so bad I didn't even bother to eat the rest. 
My husband got the burger/sushi box thing with some slider looking thing and a sushi roll. They only thing he liked out of the box was the edamame and sweet potato fries. He didn't even like the burger slider thing and he LOVES meat.

We ordered the coconut onion rings to start, and the small which was four pieces was very large and for $4 a good buy, but ours had problems. Incredibly greasy and one of the rings was the outer portion of the onion which you shouldn't have been used. 

The blackened tuna nachos came out next. A great concept, however it's a big mess. You lose the flavor profile of the individual components, aside from the crunch of the chip, the crab rangoon dip, the avocado, the tuna, they are so similar in texture you don't really know what your eating. I would have preferred a dish with all the toppings on the side you can dip into and taste.

The Pittsburgoo-shi was actually the highlight of the dinner.  It was inventive,  flavorful, the prime rib was juicy and the 'bun' was terrific. On the side we had the Thai cucumbers which were light and refreshing, with a kind of smoky heat throughout, just was great.  

Incredible service! Our server, Jasmine was attentive and friendly, helping us through the menu (it's kinda crazy how many things are actually on there). She checked in often but without being overbearing. Food and drinks came out very quickly. Two apps and one entree came out to under $40. Would I go again? I'm not entirely sure.

The wait was STUPID long and they don't take reservations. When we first came in, we were told the wait was about an hour and a half.

Everyone I was with ordered something different, but most notable were the Parmesan Bacon Truffle Fries that my cousin ordered. It was more than enough to share, and it had cheese all over the bottom of the bowl. Ooooooo man!

The first time, I was skeptical because when I see a large menu, I assume they put a 5 percent effort into each dish (like that chain restaurant a block away). I was wrong. I got the burgushi and the crab dip. My date got the turkey cranberry sandwich thing. He raved about it. 

The second time, I had the lamb burger. The feta on top could be it's own menu item, it's so big. It was fantastic! Third time, a group of us were just there for drinks. The bartender was not very knowledgeable on the beer selection. He/She had to be corrected by his/her coworker. I've also gotten the tuna burger, which I loved. 

The prices are not too bad for Southpark, but I tend to spend too much because their beer selection is GREAT and I cannot skip the crab dip.

The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because on one occasion, we waited for silverware until after the food arrived, but there A FEW hostesses by the front door just standing around staring into space. Rolling silver is probably not in their job description, but noticing we didn't have it is. There always seem to be too many hostesses standing by the front door.

Burgers and Sushi.  Who would have thought that such a combination would be so popular.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night.

Anyway, this was also my first time in trying raw sushi.    

Before my sushi roll came out, one of my table mates received theirs first which was a spicy tuna roll and I was offered a taste.  This was wonderful  Great flavors!  Why the heck did I wait so long to try sushi.  My roll came out in a few minutes.  It was the double salmon roll and while it was good, it didn't compare to the spicy tuna roll.  So now I know at least one kind of sushi to try again,

For the burger, I went with the Pesto Turkey burger which was huge and looked appetizing when it arrived.  The flavors were good but the burger was a little dry.  

For desert, I was a little disappointed with the dessert menu.  I guess I was thinking there was going to be something creative like a dessert made to look like a sushi roll but instead I found cheesecake, chocolate cake and similar desserts.   The only dessert with an asian flair were fried apple wontons.  But to go with the burger side they also had milkshakes so three of us opted for those.  The strawberry milkshake came with fresh strawberries and I ordered the grasshopper milkshake which had the right amount of mint and chocolate.

Service here was spot on.  Our server was very pleasant and helpful in explaining the menu and after offered no resistance when we asked to have our check split after receiving it.  Each of our bills was right the first time. 

I think next time I'll just do the sushi here.  The burger/sushi combo was definitely too much.  But this was a fantastic place to try sushi for the first time.

3073288,3,qjYXOBnladFYhciGBSgAMw,NBiSPO57v1m5qd_p9ViQzw,"Yet another great Charlotte restaurant I'm not sure why I've yet to review. As a sushi aficionado the Cowfish is an obvious choice. They've taken it upon themselves to lead the fusion charge in a seriously unexpected direction by mixing the delicious creatures of the land and sea in one meal for us to delight in. Well, at the time of this review I suppose it's safe to say most fusion sushi joints have pretty much joined the ""let's add beef to our sushi"" bandwagon. But as far as I'm concerned, not only was The Cowfish first, but it still stands in my mind as the best.

First off, there's getting in here. You've essentially gotta reserve a table. Don't walk up thinking ""I've heard of this pace and have to check it out, I'll go in!"" You will be hard pressed to find a table or even a spot at the bar on most nights. They book up quick and keep a waiting line out the door in most cases. It's all for good reason. There is an experience point to the place as well you know. Interior layout and decor is great. Comical actually, especially if you read a little Japanese and are familiar with the culture. The posters specifically are entertaining. Also, don't forget to take a trip to the restroom while you're here. You can relieve yourself to the sounds of random phrases spoken in English then in Chinese. It's...seriously random. They aren't even useful phrases. You'd pee yourself laughing if you weren't already peeing.

Service has been stellar in my experience so far. I've accompanied plenty of out-of-towners here and anytime somebody in the party hasn't been here before the waitstaff gives you a rundown of the menu, lots of recommendations and generally what to expect when you read the word ""burgushi"". This is great considering the menu is margin-to-margin on most pages and never-ending with options. I'm a sushi guy so naturally I gravitate towards the burgushi options. Surf 'n Turf is my personal go to favorite. It's like comfort food at the end of a long week. Angus beef tops a roll filled with salmon, tuna and cream cheese flash fried to the perfect texture. Or try the Lamb-urgushi. The name alone is funny enough to make you do it.

They've got a full bar that basically wraps around 3/4 of the restaurant. No small part of that is a sushi bar and half of the bar-top is laden with built in touchable gaming screens with lots to choose from. Outdoor seating abound for the warmer days and enclosed outdoor seating for the cold and wet days. If you're passing through, check it out, but if you live here you owe it to yourself as a Charlottean to come here at least once.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-01-12,2,review,2

It was a weekday night, so not very crowded and we got seated right away.  We had an attentive waiter and he answered most of my questions to my satisfaction, but the menu is very long and so I cannot blame him for not knowing everything on it! 
I was definitely in the mood for sushi, so ordered two specialty rolls.  Not having been here before, at first glance I thought the prices for the fusion rolls were on the higher end, but the rolls are fairly substantial.  I couldn't finish both of the rolls I ordered that night.  I wanted to have a glass of red wine, so I asked the waiter for his suggestions for a pinot noir and decided to go with the one he suggested.  I was highly disappointed with the quality of the wine, and in retrospect probably should have sent it back, but oh well.  

Overall, though, my experience was pleasant and the food was very tasty.  It's definitely not a place I would frequent often but definitely a place I will return, since the menu has quite a lot of delicious sounding dishes! 

Pros: Nice service, cute decor and not too noisy (at least on a weeknight) so you can have a conversation with the people at your table and the sushi was really tasty! 

Cons: I think the sushi prices are a little higher than expected especially the speciality rolls, compared to other sushi places I go to, and the quality of the sushi is wonderful but not beyond other good sushi restaurants for the price point.  The pinot noir the waiter recommended was mediocre, and maybe that was just an isolated incidence.  I may just stick to beer or cocktails when I go there next time. Lastly, the menu is HUGE and extensive, hence,  making it somewhat daunting to read through, especially the build your own sushi section. I would have loved to have built my own roll, but that page is not easy to maneuver through and since I am NO sushi making expert, I was hoping to rely on my waiter, but was not able to really help guide me through that particular page.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2015-07-22,0,review,0

While shopping at Express in the nearby mall the sales assistant suggested this place to eat at. The concept is great who doesn't love burgers and sushi? Located near the mall and in a very nice area Cowfish is an ideal place to grab lunch or dinner.

We had no wait but we got seated towards the back where all the kitchen commotion was. A bit loud and not as aesthetically pleasing as the rest of the restaurant we dealt with it. Our server was a bit cold and not as hospitable as other places we visited in North Carolina.

We started off with appetizers. The seaweed salad was nicely presented in a glass and was tasty. The Parmesan truffle fries was huge! The portion was more than enough for three people. We couldn't even get halfway through the fries. The truffle flavor wasn't there and was overpowered by the bacon bits. I also got a salmon skin hand roll which isn't too different from any other Japanese restaurants.

My group also ordered two bento boxes. Each bento box included a slider of the week, sushi, sweet potato fries, edamame, and a cucumber salad. The slider was less than stellar. Too much goat cheese and not enough of everything else. I felt like I was just eating cheese. The sushi was alright not anything out of the ordinary. The sweet potato fries were outstanding though! 

If i'm ever in this area again i'll probably make a trip back to this place. But don't consider driving far just because the concept is alluring.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2012-07-24,0,review,0

I don't like a billion flaps and I think how does one place specialize in so many different dishes. But it doesn't look like you can go wrong because my Southern Granny burger sandwich was awesome! One gripe: Instead of marble bread, because it gets all soggy and it's too difficult to handle I would get a Brioche bun instead. But the flavor with the friend egg, pimento cheese and grilled onions was working it! 

The sushi we ordered was aight. 

The highlight of the night was the Tall Cake. OH. MY. GOD. Layers and layers of iced lemon cake with vanilla ice cream, berries and a raspberry sauce. My God, My God it was too good. It was love in my mouth, forreal. 

The only other gripe I have is the Moscow Mules. Those teeny cups were $12 and it tasted more like Ginger Beer than anything else. I think I'll stay away fro the drinks there, but I'll definitely be back for another burger (sushi belongs to Fujo in my heart) and definitely the Tall Cake when I need a treat.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2016-11-07,1,review,1
3073300,0,Hqh3__TgG8hNSGnnmuEYhQ,14rLw76huO00Sa3Q75fL1A,I loved this place. I was here visiting a friend and I wanted to try something different. This place is great it is Asian and American food mixed together. They have an array of different burgers and other Asian inspired dishes. The sushi menu is huge and there is so much to choose from. I liked how they had a page combining burgers and sushi. I was in the mood for a burger so I ordered that. I got the long horn burger with sweet potato fries because I love sweet potato fries. The burger was delicious and juicy. It has a sweet after taste. My friends ordered the crab Rangoon appetizer. It was just like the traditional Asian version but broken apart like a dip. They had the duck sauce drizzled on the chips and then the dip on the side very good. Finally their dessert was just as hard to pick from as their regular menu. I ordered the s'more shake with Greek yogurt. I like how they give you the option to swap out things for semi healthier versions. Some restaurants get so stuck on their menu they don't let you do things like that so I appreciated it. I also forgot to mention they give you the option to essentially build your own burger. You can add and subtract different ingredients to suit your needs and they have different proteins to choose from including a veggie burger and bison. I loved this restaurant.

I'm very glad we waited. The food was delicious (not sure if that was partly because we had to wait for so long). We ordered the 3 mini burgers appetizer and the burger of the week was a blue cheese burger. For entrees we had The Taste Explosion Roll and the Foreplay Roll. Everything we had was delicious and is some of the freshest sushi I've had. My favorite was the Foreplay Roll. Definitely dine late (9:30-10pm) to avoid such a long wait time if possible.

The food is great but the restaurant refuses to take reservations and wait times are insane. Once you sit (average time waited for me was at a minimum of 45 minutes) then you will enjoy a great meal with an average service. I think the restaurant should start taking reservations that way everyone can enjoy their meal. Waiting for long it is not a good way to enjoy the great burger this place has to offer.

They have an app which you can use to place your name on the waitlist but the app is only available for Apple iPhone and there is no way to know how long you are going to wait. It is driven by the size of the fish. Really really stupid! And also by doing an app only for Apple, they are automatically excluding other customers to have the opportunity to put the name on the list as they don't take call ahead seating.

To be honest, I was a bit skeptical about this place because the fusion of burgers and sushi sounds quite bizarre and I'm not a huge fan of Asian fusion in general. I was delighted when Cowfish ended up being surprisingly delicious. My gf and I both ordered a bento box, which was half a roll and a specialty slider with three sides. My bento consisted of: half of the Tropical Storm roll, Dynamic Duo slider, sweet & spicy Thai cucumbers, sweet potato fries and bacon coleslaw. The sushi roll was scrumptious, fish was really fresh. Loved the look of the colorful tobiko. Slider was also tasty and the perfect size, any bigger and I would not have been able to finish my bento. It had juicy braised short rib, sweet roasted garlic and tomato onion jam on a Hawaiian roll, it was divine. Enjoyed all the side as well, devoured everything. Yummmm!

What made our visit memorable was our server Cameron. He was so sweet and friendly! The menu was overwhelmingly big and he took his time to answer all our questions despite being busy; the restaurant was packed.

First, the service was amazing! Our waitress offered us samplings of the beers on tap. I actually ended up not getting one but our waitress didn't mind at all. She was great!

3073326,0,k24kSTpZHUdEd-QYXLy3fQ,bg4jdthykMzMFrxxyJjglg,"In my attempt to give this particular restaurant a fair shot, I thought I would give it a few rounds so that I can give a fair review and CFSBB a better run for my money. My review is LONG so be prepared to read, however, I feel its important to give details because I waited more than one visit to give my FULL review. Mainly because I personally know of so many people that always rave about this place, WHY, is always my question. I can count a few other places i would prefer to go to before I go here. Not just because of the food but the service is not to par. Its not entirely inexpensive to go here and for what i pay here, i can give you a list of other places I would rather spend my time or money.

My first visit was during lunch service. There were not than many people and the waiter seemed friendly enough. The most pleasant part of my experience was having the ability to sit outside, but that can be said of a lot of restaurants down south, hell, Panera has a great outside area in Southpark too. The food was mediocre at best, I had sushi and this was almost two years ago but it was unmemorable enough to forget. The second time I went, same thing, lunch, waiter was friendly I tried a chicken sandwich, was just ok. Now this past weekend was my final straw to not go back. It's the holidays, its next to the mall and other higher end destination shopping, ""I get it"". That said, I took my sister out for a special bonding lunch. We walked in and the hostess was rude. I told her I would like a table for two and she said very rudely ""well it's a 30 minute wait"" as if it was going to deter me from still wanting to stay and eat, I tried to be as pleasant as possible to which I replied, ""no problem"". She seemed annoyed (?) and took my name. 

Every seat at the bar was taken and most of the tables in sight were as well. No biggie, this will give me an opportunity to ""Hang Out"" with my sister to which I stood up from the window banquet to get us a drink at the bar...wait, all of the bartenders won't even give me eye contact?! So my sister finally flagged one of them down and we ordered a beverage. We waited the full 30 minutes before we were buzzed and then approached. We were escorted to the back area where I can plainly see there were a few four tops open and then the very back area where there is a plastic enclosed area where at least 6 other tables were fully open! What on earth? 

So we sat down, happy to have a private conversation. A waitress came up to us acknowledging that we had our own drinks but that she wouldn't be OUR waitress that someone was settling into her shift so she wanted to make sure we at least had water and perhaps some appetizers, friendly and attentive enough. Well, our water comes but at this point, we are hungry, so we asked to order. We both ordered the Beneto boxes, but I personally ordered ""The Ultimate"" Brento Bento Box with the firecracker roll. An additional 20 minutes go by and our ""Official Waitress"" gets to us and takes another round of drinks, WHY not it's a Saturday afternoon. I can start to notice others around us whisper about the service and the amount of time its taking for everything. No biggie, I am having a beer and with great company so who cares. So where is my food? It took 30 minutes to get our bento boxes, I go in! The cucumber salad is delish, the edema me, well its damage ...either you like it or you don't but what is not to like?! The mini burger of the day is a sautéed mushroom with cheese and bacon, it's REALLY good actually. The Firecracker, was not particularly what I was expecting. It wasn't spicy and it was actually kind of bland. There is this man that clearly works there, he is wearing an ear piece, but he just keeps walking by really fast. He never makes eye contact, doesn't seem to make conversation with any of the patrons. My sister insists on ordering a dessert but my blue moon draft made me really full, so I passed. She tried the Apple Pie Wonton and didn't really like it. The waitress took note and asked this man that kept walking by  clearly if she could comp the dessert.... oh wait, he is a manager?????? He didn't' even look at her in the face while she asked, he seem to be in a rush to do another lap around the restaurant, talk about multitasking, working out while at work! It took longer than it should to get our check.

To start there were two hostesses, one seemed friendly but the other was a complete boob, mumbling into her headset and then to us. We had to ask her if she was even speaking to us...0 personality.
The wait was about 15 mins so we sat at the bar for a draft and a wine cooler. Service was great at the bar.
We were seated outside as per our request. Service was not so good. I know they were busy as it was 7 pm on a Friday night but you shouldn't have to go without water or drinks for 15 minutes.
We started with the crab Rangoon appetizer, it was delicious.  
My wife had the Bento box and was quite satisfied with it. She said her slider was the best part.
My daughter had the spicy crunchy shrimp and also loved it.
I had the Bison burger.......never again. Maybe it would have been better had I requested it cooked well instead of med rare. It was gross and quite a mess on the bun. Now don't get me wrong, I can usually eat anything, but the ingredient combination on this burger were not doable. The side of fried pickles were pretty good.....but not great.
During this meal we saw every other member of wait staff except ours. Other tables got better service. Even when she cleared our plates all of our glasses were empty.....she didn't notice. 
We later ordered a grasshopper milkshake......eh....it was ok.
That's when we decided to ask for water. I would have ordered another beer too but was never offered one.
I can't really say if I'll ever go back but I would like to try the sushi.
I'm convinced this place has an absentee owner or they were on vacation because no one would have a hostess like the one we dealt with.

VERY busy at 12:15 on a Saturday, but we wanted sushi, and were immediately seated at the sushi bar--rather than wait the 30 minutes for a table. My ONLY complaint was the level of noise in the restaurant, amplified by no ceiling. But that was the only negative. The selection is large on the sushi & sushimi menu, and the wait staff were ALL most friendly and very attentive, without being in the way. My wife had a Queen City roll, which was so good she neglected to let me try it...no matter, as my King's roll was huge, incredibly fresh, and produced a mouthgasm for me. My O'Douhl's non-alcoholic Amber was ice cold an served in a frosted glass...the perfect accoutrement for the very spicy--but certainly not hot, by any stretch--Kings Roll. We split the lobster & crab spring roll for an appetizer, nearly too artistically presented to eat;  but we somehow managed and these 4 spring rolls DID NOT disappoint in the least.
Funky and cheery atmosphere, just too noisy for our 61 year old ears. However, way above excellent foot and service...absolutely worth finding around the Crate & Barrel. Go, please go!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2016-01-31,0,review,0

It was bustling, especially for a Tues night, so we had to wait 15 min for a table.  It was a good time to do some people watching and peruse the environment.  The decor is polished and hip - could fall on either side of the casual / fine dining line.  There is a huge fish tank, good lighting, and interesting - sometimes comic - art on the walls.  The crowd was young, lots of 20 somethings versus the business dinner crowd.

As for the food...  There is a huge menu and it is slightly overwhelming.  Their sushi rolls are giant, eclectic, and are pretty good.  I shared some sushi with my dining mates and then opted for the bento box - which basically allows you to sample the highlights of their menu.  It included a little burger (tasty), sweet potato fries (very good), sushi (delicious), a spicy cucumber salad (rockin), and some edamame.  Great meal!

Plan on spending approximately $25 per person with food and a modest beer.  Not too bad for good atmosphere and fun food.

Our waitress was friendly and helpful in navigating us through the menu.  There was an error in one of our sides and a little delay in it coming out - though no complaints from us - so the manager stopped by to apologize and comped the bill.

A: The Nature Boy's Woooooooooooshit buffalooooo - it's an explosion of flavors in your mouth.  Spicy so be warned, that last taste of jalapeno really gets you.  It is exactly what you'd expect a burgushi, a burger in the form of sushi rolls.

And it's not just sushi! Burgers and burgers they refer to as ""Burgushi"" which is a fusion of a burger and a sushi roll. I can't even begin to capture the essence of this place, other than the sushi bar surrounds the entire interior of the restaurant with a large freshwater tank as the focal point.  Since I don't want to demolish the uniqueness of what they do here is a snip-it from their website:

""The Cowfish brings to the world the first restaurant focusing on offering both the best sushi AND the best burger in town. Fresh, innovative and delicious, the sushi segment of the menu is a unique balance of traditional and unconventional. All natural, creative and hearty, the burgers entice with fresh ingredients and bold flavors. Spiked hand-spun milkshakes, premium sakes, craft beers, wine and 10oz exotic martinis round out a huge bar menu that is sure to please. The Cowfish aims to offer something for the entire family. Scrumptious appetizers for sharing, entree-sized salads, homemade desserts and a fun kid's menu are joined by our signature creations that we call ""Burgushi""! A cutting edge fusion of burger and sushi, burgushi items include sushi rolls created using burger components, and pick-up style sandwiches created using sushi components. If you can't make up your mind, try a bento box to sample a mini-burger along with your choice of sushi roll and three tasty side items!""

My friend and I decided that if we were to go, we would definitely go on a Tuesday as they have there $5 10oz Martini Special. And lets just say that did not disappoint. They have some interesting Martini's going on here, but I started off with the ""Chocolate Dipped Fortune Cookie"" Martini which contained an Amaretto and Bailey's combo with a hint of vanilla vodka and my friend started off with the ""Magnificent Mango"" Martini which contained Mango liqueur and vanilla vodka. Both were excellent!!! 

We advised the waiter this was our first time at Cowfish, and he went thru the whole Menu (as it is pretty large) and informed us of ""what we need to know"" to get thru and understand the Cowfish experience. 

We deiced to start off with the ""Crab & Avocado Rolls"" Appetizer which are crispy spring rolls filled with lump crab meat, fresh avocado and tomatoes & Served with cashew and cilantro pesto..... This went perfect with the Martini's!!! 

Now as for the Entrees I'm not a big Sushi Eater, so I was definitely on the ""Cow"" portion of ""CowFish"" and my friend was all about some Sushi, so she ordered the ""Fish"" portion... LOL. So I can't really talk about the Sushi here in this review, but I will talk about my Burger. So I ended up ordering the ""Shroomin' Swiss Burger"" which is a Beef burger loaded with Swiss cheese and sautéed mushrooms. Served with roasted garlic aioli, lettuce and tomato on a brioche bun. And my Side that I ordered was the Sweet Potato Fries. I have to say... this was alittle piece of Heaven!!!! The burger was cooked to perfection, and the Sweet Potato fries were just right.... definitely not overdone. 

In between our delicious meal it was Martini time again, and we decided to switch it up this time.... I ordered the ""Cheeky Monkey"" which contained Malibu, Midori, Cointreau, vodka, pineapple, cream, fresh lime and my friend ordered the ""Orange Rush"" which contained Orange vodka, Apple Pucker, with splashes of Sprite and sour. Again both were excellent, but I think I may have preferred the Cheeky Monkey just a little bit more than the Chocolate Dipped Fortune Cookie. Also noticed that others who ordered the Fortune Cookie Martini actually had real Fortune cookie on the side of the Martini glass, which is a nice touch, but Mine was absent when it came to my table. 

But overall I was very pleased with this place. The atmosphere was great. I definitely recommend reservations if you wanting an actual table as there aren't that many. It seems most people sit at the Bar because its HUGE, and goes a long the entire restaurant. Also loved some of the artwork on the walls!!!

The food is fine, but it is definitely fusion. Don't look for authentic here! I had the hamachi (yellowtail) topped with a slice of jalapeno and ponzu sauce, plus a roll. The roll was fine. It was all fine. Just not memorable. The atmosphere and the crazy menu were more memorable.

What gives this place, to me at least, the full five stars is the customer service.  When managing such an ""in"" place as The Cowfish, everything needs to run smoothly and have a great staff in place.  This was proved last night when the patio was full and the place was packed!  A minor glitch in the system happened when it started pouring rain.  Luckily most tables on the patio were almost finished and hussled out, but my friend and I literally just got our appetizer (the greatest nacho creation ever) and drinks (they carry Bells's!!!).  A few umbrellas were moved and we dined in the rain.  It was beautiful out and the patio was EMPTY.  Made for a great experience and the food couldn't have been better.  The management staff and a few different waiters came to check on us numerous times, braving the rain (which we both kept laughing at) and made it a memerable time.

The menu is extensive and has tons of different categories of options. The sushi is mostly tempura stuff, the focus is not on fresh raw fish. And, after taking my chances on midwest/non-coastal area sushi and living in the bay area for a bit, I've become somewhat of a sushi snob unfortunately. SO decided to go for their bison burger (sans buns, it is gluten free!) They also had tons of other great looking beef burgers, a lamb burger, etc. I love that their meat is antibiotic/hormone free. 

The bartender who took my takeout order was super friendly and checked with the chef to make sure the meat wasn't seasoned with any gluten, etc. which I really appreciated. I got it with pesto and avocado, and got the cucumber salad on the side. The portion is great, the burger was delightful - perfectly cooked and SO tasty! Would definitely come back here. 

Note: the hostess (or whoever picked up the phone that night when I called at first) was really unpleasant. I asked about gluten in their bison burger, pesto, etc. and she kept waving me off saying ""I don't think so, I'm sure it's fine.""

But even with all the positive feedback, I still had my doubts. Burgers and Sushi: do those really go together? Plus, on the menu online they didn't seem to have many vegetarian options. However; once I finally made it there, all my doubts went away! 

This place is amazing, great food, and unique pairings. Their veggie burger has a homemade patty, and their sides seem simple, but are made so unique you wont recognize them once you've ordered. I got onion rings, and they were fried in coconut batter and tempura, then dipped in horseradish. Asian inspired diner food: amazingly creative.

I got a taste explosion roll and my friend got a bento box. After stuffing an entire piece of the roll into my mouth, I thought I loved it. It was a fabulous confusing mixture of sushi and a burger swimming about. Then as I had my second and third roll I couldn't lie to myself anymore. The concoction of a burger with sushi had an overwhelming conflicting taste that just did not work together. I did not despise the roll but it just did not meet my expectation. I am sure there is some way you can befriend the flavors of sushi and burgers but this was not it. As for the bento box, there was nothing too special other than seeing sweet potato fries and edamame served as a side next to each other. 

Asides from the food, the restaurant had a great vibe. Red and black decor with this sweet fish tank. PLEASE NOTE THE FISH TANK! I saw nemo, dori, and some other characters from finding nemo and then this fugly looking fish. As I was waiting for my food, I decided to look up where the name originated from and to my surprise, I saw a COWFISH! I do not see the cow resemblance with the fish but they had a cowfish swimming in their tank! Props. So... this place is definitely worth going to to experience the bizarre food with Andrew Zimmern but I personally did not love the food. (the mojito was delish tho)

I have been going to Cowfish for over 2 years. It is the perfect spot for taking your visitors when they don't know exactly what they want. It's even better for the ""weirdos"" (no offense) who don't like sushi but could go for a burger. It has the best of both worlds and even options for veggie heads.

This time was a tad different because we were given a pet fish to watch ""grow"" as we waited. The premise was that when the fish got big enough it was then ""caught"" and our table was ready (a pic of our fish was uploaded, Mackerel Jordan). For those of us that are easily amused, it was very entertaining. 

As promised, after a 20 minute wait (be prepared to wait AT LEAST an hour if you come on a Friday/Saturday evening) we were sat on the back patio. Despite the fact that it was quite warm outside, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal: 

Appetizer: crab rangoon dip (it's like a crab wonton undone its warm gooey-ness is absolutely delicious)

Burger: Porky's Revenge (Half-pound beef burger, pulled pork, smoked gouda cheese, onion strings, bacon coleslaw, BBQ sauce, lettuce, pickles, brioche bun) OMG da BOMB for pulled pork lovers like me!

Bento: The Ultimate Brento Box (A combo meal featuring both burger and sushi, including a double-stack version of the featured mini-burger of the week, sweet potato fries, Thai cucumbers, edamame and the guest's choice of a 4 piece premium Fusion Specialty roll [Firecracker, The Boss or Blackened Tuna Roll]) It is perfect (not the perfect size for everyone as it is a small portion) for that person who wants the best of both worlds!

Sushi: Bagel Roll (Smoked salmon, kani, cream cheese roll battered and flash fried, topped with sweet eel sauce) Honestly, cream cheese on ANY roll is amazing, you won't regret it!

No I didn't eat ALL of this by myself, I shared a ""bite"" with everyone! And no I didn't drink THIS time but, last plug I promise, the Cheeky Monkey Martini was great! Seriously, no one regrets Cowfish (well your wallet might hence the four stars, check out prices before you come)!

Usually when you order $22 worth of sushi you should leave satiated. The sushi is mediocre tasting, lacking flavour and fish! I could barely taste the salmon. On my first visit I had tried the bento box and it was less than memorable. The burger portion was tasty , but it was the size of a slider and the sushi part was bland.

3073374,0,_uqIpl5tzucKuIlZZPBZRw,nZJjW33tFw8nEpVcBICQ-g,"We went to Cowfish this past Sunday night and arrived around 6:30 PM.  Who knew that on a Sunday night in Charlotte I'd need a reservation?   Our party of seven waited 45 minutes for a table.  Everyone was very nice, though, and even the manager apologized to us for the long wait.  I think the problem is that Cowfish has a huge bar to sit at (and I mean HUGE; it starts on one side of the restaurant, wraps around, and continues for miles down the other side) and not a lot of ""large"" tables.   Now I know, though, so I won't be caught off guard in the future.  I've never seen a restaurant in Charlotte so busy on a Sunday night, that's why I didn't think to make a reservation.

At any rate, I loved looking around the restaurant.  It's come a long way since it was The Counter.  The walls are painted a deep red and extend high up into the warehouse-like black painted ceiling.  The bar (which I mentioned earlier) takes up a lot of space.  If you're a couple, it makes a great spot to sit, talk, eat, and drink.  Any more than two people, though, and conversation is probably difficult.  The giant paintings on the red wall are humorous knock-offs of famous art pieces or pop culture icons.  Burger King getting dissed by Wendy?  ""Fine, have it your way.""  Classic.  

Our server (very friendly and attentive) explained the menu to us.  If you thought the menu at Cheesecake Factory was a book, check out the menu at Cowfish.  You need about 20 minutes to look over everything just to begin to narrow down your choices. 

Since we had waited so long for a table, we started with the Sticks, Sweets & Strings -- regular fries, sweet potato fries, and onion strings.  For $5, it was incredibly huge and plenty for sharing with a large group.  Plus, it all tasted so good.

While we waited for our table, I noticed a group of women who had HUGE sushi rolls on their plates.  Their diameter was the size of my wrist.  So when I saw the Fusion Specialties section of the menu featuring ""entree-sized sushi rolls"" for more money than the hamburger entrees, I assumed that's what they had ordered.  I finally decided on the ""Mark's Roll"" - fresh tuna, jalapeno, cream cheese, kani and scallion roll, coated with panko and flash fried, topped with Japanese cream sauce and sriracha, and served with ponzu dipping sauce.  Everyone else ordered burgers.  When our dinners were delivered, I was quite disappointed to find that my entree-sized sushi roll was no bigger than a larger-sized sushi roll at another restaurant.  It wasn't really ""entree-sized"" when everyone else got a HUGE, stacked burger with fries.  Don't get me wrong -- it was delicious, but I'd stick to getting a couple of the cheaper sushi rolls next time or else a big, thick, juicy burger.  For $10, they looked like quite the value.  

And, speaking of value, the kids' meals are about $5 on average.  There is a wide variety of choices for kids, and the meals come in bento boxes where every little cubby hole is FILLED with different foods.  The kids even got more food than me!

I'm looking forward to going back to Cowfish (despite my smaller meal) because there are SO many things to try on the menu (there's even a wide variety of salad entree choices), the prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere is classy, yet casual.  I'll just remember to make a reservation next time!  (Or sit at one of the many, many spots along the lonnnnnnnnnnnng bar.) 

And, yes, there really is such a thing as a cowfish.  And you can see them swimming in the giant fish tank on the other side of the bar as you walk in the restaurant.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2011-01-13,4,review,1

3073377,0,pklva9BUEvq3jtPL8Y8KDQ,Q5r-FH_zX17MBXCb_zl8qg,"ah, i remember the good ole days when i was able to walk in to the cowfish sans reservation and get seated in a reasonable amount of time.

if last thursday night is any indication, it looks like that kind of a lark won't be happening again soon.  when a joint demands weekday reservations, you know it's hit it big.

around the time the restaurant first opened in the space formally occupied by ""the counter"" and ""the grape"", i was somewhat concerned that a restaurant with this kind of concept would not catch on in an economy with high demands and sullen creativity.

in this instance, i'm more than happy to be wrong.

the combination of sushi and burgers isn't the first thing one thinks of when trying to make suggestions for dinner, but i've got to admit, it sure is memorable.

alas, i've also got to admit that the burgers are much better than the sushi.  after trying several different rolls and an assortment of burgers, i feel pretty confident in saying that nikko on south boulevard still retains the queen city sushi crown.  the fish on the caterpillar roll at the cowfish was not as fresh as it could have been, the nigiri was just okay, and my moriawase double deuce (sushi combination platter) did not compete well with my husband's boursin burger.  it's not that the sushi sucked - it's just that the burgers stood out more.  the only exception to that rule appears to be the make-your-own-sushi roll.  my veganish friends fell in love with their own vegetable concoction that was surprisingly awesome, if i do say so myself.

the sweet potato fries rocked, and i fell completely for the blackened ahi tuna nachos . . . even as i write those words, my mind drifts into a momentary recollection of their avocado-laced deliciousness.  i'm convinced that the individual who first paired tuna with avocado must now be a chef in the kitchen upstairs.  in terms of burgers, i've really enjoyed the aforementioned boursin burger, loved the cbclt, and thought the mediterranean lamb burger was fabulous.

the vibe is solidly modern at the cowfish, if a bit quirky.  i think the owners thought they needed to embrace as much odd as possible in a joint with such a unique concept.  visit the w.c. and hear the strangest malarkey in an array of languages . . . making you tilt your head and think ""wtf?"".  honestly, i thought it was just as charming as the cute rendition of ""guernica"" arranged on a bloodred wall (complete with the requisite ""cowfish"").

save for one occasion at the beginning where it took an absolutely ridiculous amount of time to receive our food, the service has been very solid.  on that occasion in question, i will say that one of the owners came to our table to personally apologize for the delay.  i always wonder why it is that other owners/managers don't showcase the same level of concern - it absolutely makes a world of difference.

hell, we went back (with ten other people) . . .

The ""Burgushi"" bento box selection is usually my go-to as you can sample a small sushi roll, a slider-size burger, and sides (sweet potato fries, edamame, and cucumbers). They even have 3 selections of bentos.

This visit I tried the all-jalapeno everything burger. A pretty good sized burger, tasty, and mine was cooked the way I wanted it, but my friend's slider was way too pink for the medium-well she requested. Must be tougher on smaller burgers without overdoing it.

My husband and I both had Bento Boxes. I feel this is a good lunch choice. A little beef, a little sushi and some extra yummies added in the box. Who knew Edamame and Sweet potato fries would taste so good together.

I got the burger with flambé banana, peanut butter, bacon and cheese. Personally I loved it. Flavors were so oddly complementary. I should note I make smoothies regularly with bananas and peanut butter, if you don't really love them try a different one ;p

Aside from great food the atmosphere was excellent, the beer selection was great (I had Wooden Robot's Chocolate Stout) and my waitress was very attentive and actually hung out quite a bit and shot the shit as I was there late and by myself.

There is a massive menu of both burgers, sushi and even salads, sides...  that makes it easy for most people to find options.  I'm a vegetarian and had no problems.  The food does always taste good though.  

What is unique about Cowfish is that you can order something you've probably never had like the burushi or alcoholic milkshakes.  The experience would be much more satisfying if the wait wasn't so long (the bar area is always full too).",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2014-05-29,0,review,0

This place always has a lively atmosphere and their sushi is really good and fresh. My favorite item is the Blackened Tuna BLT. It is an absolutely glorious burger.

One of my favorite places in Charlotte. I often save this place for when I would really like to splurge because I often want several things off the menu. The menu is HUGE!  We often find ourselves here for date night, birthdays, or when I have out of town guests because there is something for everyone.

My favorite thing to start with is the Crab Rangoon dip. So good!

Next is your hardest decision yet- burger or sushi? Both are amazing here, which is difficult to pull off and Cowfish has done just that.  If you can't decide go with a bento box. It has edamame, cucumbers, a burger slider, and a sushi roll. Just enough food for one person and not too much food to where they have to roll you outside. They also have burgushi (a fusion of a burger and sushi). I've never had this, but I have had a family member have some and they were very satisfied.

You will be satisfied with any burger, really. And any sushi roll. Have at it. 

The place has great cocktails, craft beer, and even spiked milkshakes, so you will not be disappointed with drinks. I have had one of the spiked shakes and they are delish. 

Lastly, get the s'mores milkshake. Just do it. It is incredible. I never spend the money on dessert, but it's so worth it and I get it every time I am here. Just a tip: they are one of the few places to still do free dessert on someone's birthday, so this is why we often find ourselves here on birthdays b/c they will sing and bring the birthday person cake. 

There is almost always a wait, so plan ahead for this, but it is worth it. The earlier you go the better usually.

It isn't terribly expensive, but I often spend $50- $75 after you get drinks, appetizer, food, and dessert. This is why this is often a splurge for me, but so worth it. 

This is the only place in the world that can get shut down for Norovirus and people are ready to bang down the doors the second the professional cleaning is over and they are back in business b/c the food is seriously amazing lol. Way to go.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2016-08-24,1,review,0

Sat in the sushi bar area, at the bar. Cool touch screens built into to counter tops, except they don't work very well at all. Still pretty cool. 

LOTS of staff about, except they are all cleaning and not really paying attention to customers.

It took a WHILE to get an order in, couldn't get my check in a timely manner, didn't get my tea refilled....this actually became pretty amusing, then frustrating. It was after traditional lunch hour. (I arrived about 1:40 pm, and the efforts of the employees present were spent on doing everything except looking after me.)

Ordered the lunch special bento box w/burger, which also took a while to receive. HOWEVER, it was really, really good.

So, my experience: Kitchen - ""good"" -- Service - ""Lacking"" -- Cleanliness - ""good"" as I witnessed a LOT of cleaning going on around me, and not-so-much attention to getting me in and out at lunch time.

Remember Limp Bizkit and Korn?  They couldn't do one thing well so they decided to go the fusion route and made a shitty mess (along with Creed) of the late-90s music scene.  Do you see where I'm going with this?  Always the cynic, I feel that fusion restaurants take the easy route and mix things together so they don't have to actually be good at something.  To me, fusion and heavy sauces can both be listed under the heading:  How To Cover All Your Cooking Sins.  

Cowfish is different.  Cowfish is Led Zeppelin.  Blues/rock.  Burger/sushi.  Cowfish rocks.  

I went 100% fish on my visit here, so I'll have to contribute a later review of the burgers.  I used to date a girl who said ""if you're going to be a bear, be a grizzly.""  Go big or go home.  Ginny and I got our grizzly on and went straight for The Motherload.  This enormous roll showcases every type of fish on the Cowfish menu (as well as a piece of rare roast beef).  The menu touted that ""the presentation will blow you away.""  They do not tell a lie.  The presentation was beautiful and I will be bold enough to state that Cowfish's fish quality is equal to that of Nikko's.  Prior to eating said roll, we considered ordering the tuna nachos but shied away due to the presence of rangoon sauce on the nachos.  Rangoon is a really fun word to say, but mayonnaise is quite possibly the most foul substance on the face of the earth.  Our thoughts changed, however, when our neighbors to the right ordered the nachos.  Delicious.  I try to avoid listing every last detail of a dish when writing my reviews (leaving me more room to comment on music and my personality shortcomings), so I'll simply say that you should try these nachos when you visit Cowfish.  But between this day and that, say ""rangoon"" as often as possible and thank all that is holy for not having to see Fred Durst on the TV anymore.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2011-05-20,1,review,0

Well, my 4 stars are for the food.

We walked in late the other night and the hostess looked incredibly confused that we wanted to be seated at a table instead of the bar. But apparently she wasn't able to seat us?!?

Hopped on two stools at the bar and ordered glasses of water. Food was simple: Parmesan truffle fries with bacon on the side, a Neon Dion roll for the Mr, and for me, the green monster burger with their veggie burger instead of beef.

The fries were impressive. As in...we ate them all unapologetically.

It was probably my third time ordering the green monster with a veggie burger, and this time I asked for the bun on the side. Didn't want to miss out on even a forkful of the action. As a side, I went with the cucumbers. 

Let's just say that I looked like a quasi-homeless person scooping burger and cucumber into my face with reckless abandon. It's just so good.

So sure, go to The Cowfish. But don't freak out if you have a half-hour wait because it's so popular. Also, don't freak out if the service is a bit nonchalant. Ultimately, the food is solid.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2013-08-21,3,review,2

Admittedly, we order apps (in retrospect - not necessary). The deconstructed crab rangoon (dip) was a hit - especially with my daughter. Very good chicken satay and cucumber salad.

Yes, it was as big as it sounds. Leftovers for days.

One thing that was off was the wait for seating. We were told that there was no wait and yet were handed a pager.

3073606,1,pl81LgL-HSIn_cB0FkgxqQ,TDJSdaFAuR5eGk3ume93sg,"This is a restaurant that flaunts its stuff in the face of convention. Its menu is a mile long and paved with flavorful pabulum. It's like an enormous treasure map covered with X's. And the real secret behind the goodness? The wait. Something about standing around for an hour waiting to be seated makes the food taste twice as good. So don't be bitter about the line; it's there for good reason.

Cowfish is the perfect ""couples"" restaurant. It's not particularly romantic - the constant stream of people coming and going prevents an intimate ambiance - but burgers for him and sushi for her? Sheer brilliance. At $25-$40 for two (closer to $40 with drinks), it wouldn't threaten to cut too big a hole in your wallet if it wasn't so addicting.

Like I said, the menu is big, but you find your niche by the second or third trip. My niche is the burger menu, and my go-to is the most counter-intuitive meal on a menu filled with bizarre creations: the ""Hunka, Hunka Burnin' Love."" This Elvis-inspired burger features two half-pound beef patties (though I tend to request just one), two slices of applewood-smoked bacon, fried banana, and a big gob of peanut butter nestled in a sweet Hawaiian roll. My friends tend to cringe when I tell them about it, but trust me, one bite and you'll be saying, ""Thank you very much."" Here's a tip: substitute one of Cowfish's home-ground, Chipotle-seasoned bison patties for the beef. It'll cost you $4 more, but the Chipotle adds a nice, spicy kick to offset the semi-sweet peanut butter/banana combo. Burgers come with a generous side item, and Cowfish has some of the most savory sweet potato fries around. It'll take several trips to fully explore the burger menu, but after doing some extensive exploration myself, I'm sticking with the Hunka.

Since there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of sushi rolls to choose from, I'll go ahead and and mention my fiancee's favorite. **Disclaimer: she is a bit of a health nut.** She goes straight for the ""Build-Your-Own Sushi"" option, selecting seaweed and brown rice wrapped around generous portions of Ahi tuna, mango, and avocado. I don't care much for sushi, but I dig that roll. From time to time she'll order a Bento Box, which features a mini-burger of the week, and if we're really hungry, we might order the ""Avocado & Ahi Tuna-Tini"" or the ""Blackened Ahi Tuna Nachos"" for a starter. **Second disclaimer: we like tuna.** Their spiked shakes are indulgent, but be wise about dessert. Chances are, you'll already be full.

Lastly, I would be remiss not to mention the bathrooms. As soon as you walk in, you'll hear a series of voices overhead. First, you will hear someone say something in proper English. Then, you will hear the phrase repeated in Indonesian. Finally, you will hear the phrase re-told in redneck dialect. You'll walk in and wonder what on earth is going on, then you'll walk out saying things like, ""Jim Bob's more nervous than a cat in a room with a room full of rocking chairs!""

There may be restaurants in Charlotte with more privacy and less wait time, but there are no other restaurants quite like Cowfish. I give it five stars and a hug and a kiss.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2013-04-09,2,review,2

Their menu features many standard sushi combinations as well as many new and interesting items too.  As well there is a large buger and other sandwich menu for those who enjoy their food cooked.

I'd definately recommend getting reservations as the place was packed at 8pm on a Wednesday, but luckily I got the last available bar stool.  The drink prices are typical for the area and the food is on the higher priced side, but well worth it.

The concept of this restaurant itself is great; there aren't too many places that serve up the sushi - burger combination! The ambiance is neat, and the staff very friendly. But not everything about Cowfish is praise worthy. There are a couple negatives in addition to the long wait times. the menu is ridiculously extensive, and therefore confusing! and... the prices are kinda crazy too (specially the sushi.) The burgers & sandwiches are decently priced, but can't say the same about the sushi, appetizers or drinks.

This was quite tasty, but I didn't understand why they cream cheese was a blob on one side of the mini burger instead of distributed more evenly. The sushi was quite...meh. I chose the blackened tuna roll. It was trying too hard and didn't quite hit the spot. The guacamole on top was just weird. The cucumber salad was tasty, but more pickle flavored. Edamame was well cooked, but again the chef just tosses a ton of salt in one place. I chose sweet potato fries which were quite perfect!

Maybe because I heard horror stories about the ridiculously long lines, maybe because so many places with similar reputations just don't live up to hype.....I don't know. But my best friends were in town and I decided to pick an ""off time"" to dine (we went at 3pm on a Sunday), if there is ever such a time at this establishment. And thankfully, the wait was less than 10 minutes and we grabbed a seat outside on this lovely day.

First thing we noticed was the HUGE and exhaustive menu. My Gawd....there's more choices on the menu than people named Chin in a Chinese telephone book! Not necessarily a bad thing, mind you. But sometimes you got to wonder if having TOO many choices can lead to execution errors? Maybe I've been watching too many Food Network/Kitchen Nightmare programs......

Back to the review. We started with their coconut battered onion rings with 2 types of dipping sauces: 1 was your traditional ranch style sauce (with Sriracha or horseradish I believe) and another was a Thai sweet chili sauce. Both were excellent, and the onion was surprisingly VERY good. Not soggy at all, crisp with excellent flavor. Great start.

On to the sushi rolls. Got the Mark's Roll which is not on their online menu. It had tuna and cream cheese in it. Tempura battered and flash fried. Need I say more? Was delicious. Not uber flavorful but the texture contrast was excellent. Also tried their Blackened Tuna roll, with lump crab meat, and sliced jalapenos. Almost tasted like a mini crab cake, with heat. Was good. Not the best sushi I've ever had but a solid roll. 

My buddy Dean got the Ultimate Bento Box, which had a very delicious sushi roll, an excellent blend of Thai Sweet/Heat cucumber salad, a double stacked mini burger, edamame and some sweet potato fries. Very good. His wife Lisa got the Greek Salad, which was HUGE! Tip for Ladies......this is one LARGE salad! It would have feed all of us big guys at the table.....just sayin.....And it WAS yummy with fried battered pepperoncinis! Never had them like that before. My buddy and I both got their burgers, as this after all IS supposedly a burger joint! I got the Black Truffle Cheeseburger (they had me at truffle) and my buddy Steve got Boursin Bacon Burger (they had him with Boursin/Bacon). Both met my burger criteria of SLOPPY (meaning uber juicy), flavorful, and cooked no more than MEDIUM (for flavor). The mushrooms were fresh and black truffle cheese excellent! Oh and they serve them on BRIOCHE! I mean, who doesn't love a buttery brioche! The French are probably cringing that we Americans put a BURGER on them! But WTF, who CARES! It was AWESOME to have those flavors stuck between buttery pieces of soft bread! Good call Cowfish!

Finally, like THAT wasn't enough food, my buddy Steve gets a Carmel Chocolate Espresso Milkshake! He really need those extra 1000 or so calories to wash down the 3000 we just consumed! But boy was it delicious!

Tip #2: If you're on ANY kind of diet whatsoever, Cowfish is NOT YOUR PLACE! ""Danger Will Robinson - the Calories are attacking!"" But if you want excellent and flavorful food, then Cowfish IS the place for you! I had to ""suspend"" my diet for this day.....now I've got to bicycle around the world twice and ingest 5 doses of Lipator to get back on track....Can't wait to go back to try their PRIME TIME FILET & LOBSTER ROLL.

3073619,0,Q9UIMNtTjFOt5gcvKlO0eg,OFIBtADBQsYKQw-y0FasHg,"Honestly, the deciding factor to try The Cowfish last night was the fact that they serve food until midnight. With the time of our arrival being 11:30pm, I was not expecting the level of service and quality of the food to be as exceptional as it was. We arrived about 11:30 and were fed and happy and out by 12:05. Not even once did we feel rushed. The food came out quickly and it was very tasty.

Every interaction with the staff there was exceptional. Our server explained the menu and made great recommendations. From the time we walked in until the time we left, we felt welcomed. Everyone was so friendly. And our drink glasses never got empty. They were on top of our refills before we realized that we were close to being out. 

Many places bill themselves as ""Asian Fusion"", but this place truly pushes the ""fusion"" boundary and explores some fantastic combinations. We found that (unlike many places) the more complicated the sushi/burgushi, the more delicious it was. Be forewarned that each roll is very large. One roll will fill you up easily. 

Here is the run-down of what we ordered:
Sweet & Spicy Pork Potstickers : Slightly spicy balanced with a slightly sweet peanuty sauce. Different and delicious. 
The Taste Explosion : It's like a great burger in sushi form. This was one of our favorites. 
The Boss: This was a complicated roll that was fabulous. 
Spider Roll: very delicious, the crab was cooked perfectly. 
Spicy Tuna Roll: large roll, simple and wonderful.

Needless to say, we ordered waaaaaaay too much. We just had the leftovers for lunch and they are still delicious!

I'll base my review on the two times I've dined there - once for lunch and once for dinner. Here's the scoop:

Be sure to get a reservation. This place is constantly slammin' and each time I went there was a long wait (an hour for lunch and 2.5 hours for dinner). Good thing we thought to call ahead or I would not have had the chance to indulge....

The decor is interesting. Everything from the red walls to the cartoon art to the voiceover in the bathroom translating sayings...all eye catching and very entertaining.

Parking is not a problem. You may have to head over to the parking deck, but it's not too far of a walk.

Service is great. Our server was very informative, attentive, and friendly both times we dined. The manager came over when we went to lunch, and since it was my boyfriend's first time, gave us a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit. That's a great way to keep people coming back.

The food is phenomenal (and good luck narrowing it down with that crazy large menu). In terms of appetizers, I've had the crab rangoon dip and the coconut onion rings - both of which I'd have again. But if you're only going for one, get the dip - not low fat by any stretch, but totally worth it. I've had the tropical storm roll and the mango tango roll as entrees - both of which were some of the best sushi I've had - but ask them to slice into 10 pieces instead of 8 - when sliced into 8, the pieces are just way too big. My boyfriend had a burger and has been talking about going back ever since. We also got a chocolate and a mint chocolate milk shake to go and they were so thick that we had to wait a bit for the ice cream to melt to really enjoy them (as all milkshakes should be, in my humble opinion). The drink menu is also very extensive and I can't wait to go back to try some of their martinis. And all prices are reasonable for the location and sheer amount of food you are given.

Ultimately, you're missing out if you don't try Cowfish. Just make sure to call early for a reservation (I know, I know - I said that before, but I don't see the wait times dwindling any time in the near future).",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2011-01-24,6,review,4

If you've ever had bang bang shrimp from bonefish grill it's similar but better. The sauce is light but still spicy and the asian slaw is soooo good. I also usually get the Granny's Southern Pimento Cheese Burger.... something about getting pimento cheese and a fried green tomato on a burger is just sinful. So good. I don't necessarily have a favorite sushi dish because everything I've tried has been really good. I also got a milkshake that was the icing on the cake.

That's right, why choose between getting fish or getting beef? Get the best of both worlds!  I added two pieces of yellowtail sashimi to my burger and it was a great combo...that is a rare opportunity to get together.

The environment is good too, especially for kids (and the young at heart) with interactive games and video material built into the bar.  Great staff too.

They have done away with the smaller meat options, like the 1/3 lb burger, so you have to bring your appetite.  Some sauces and add-ons are no longer available.  The delicious milkshakes did survive the transition!  The menu steers Cowfish to being more of a dinner place than a lunch place, which is a disappointment.

On a Saturday afternoon this place was packed. There was about a 20 minute wait when I arrived, but luckily there was a single seat at the bar that I was able to grab, skipping the line. I was greeted quickly by one of the bartenders and handed a menu. He grabbed me a glass of water while I hunted through the large list of drinks.

I landed on The Hershey Swiss spiked milkshake ($10). Its a chocolate shake with booze in it. What's not to like? It was delicious and a nice change from all the beer I had been drinking through the week.

The menu here is quite large. Take a great burger place that has tons of options and mix it with a sushi place that has a healthy choice of rolls, then add some specialties that make this restaurant unique and you can start to see how the menu can get long. Now we're not saying its like reading War and Peace just to get a meal here. The menu is organized and clear, you just might have to get the server over to help narrow down your choices.

I went with their ""Burgushi"" specialty and chose the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich with a side of their Thai Cucumbers ($14). The sandwich was a blackened seared rare Ahi tuna, sliced up and was topped with bacon, tomato salsa, jalapenos, and slaw. Their ""bun"" is cool. Its rice and kani (crab) wrapped in rice paper. Its then grilled to give it a texture like you would expect from a traditional bun.

The sandwich was great, though a little messy. The bacon gave the sandwich a nice crunchy texture to go against the soft tuna so you don't feel like you're eating a sandwich of mush. I didn't really get any flavour from the tomato salsa or slaw, but there was some nice heat on the back end from the jalapenos. The Thai cucumbers were excellent and had a nice spiciness to them.

For $30 including the tip this was a great weekend lunch.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2013-10-20,0,review,0

Stick with the sashimi grade fish and burgers. The burgushi isn't that great, maybe I'll try more of those selections in the future. The lobster and crab spring rolls were great and reminded me of the pappadeaux rendition.

I did enjoy my greasy and overly topped (good thing in this case) jalapeño show stopper burger with fresh otoro and saba sushi on the side. The Saba (mackerel) was very good and the burger with sweet potato fries was good as well.

The menu is explained to you and leaves you with a plethora of options to customize your dining experience. 


Burgushi: Who the hell would have ever thought? I didnt try it because I absolutely fell in LOVE with the Turkey apple brie and cranberry burger which I F$&ked my mouth with twice on my last visit. Its unbelievable to witness the flavor that will burst into your mouth and nearly knock you out of your seat. 


Fried pickles - my FAV for several reasons but most importantly that I didnt spend the next 5 min extracting vegetable oil from them to eat. 


Design your own sushi roll = BRILLIANT concept that I have YET to see in any other metropolitan area.


The only thing that disappoints me is the location. I mean after all, location is everything and this wonderful gem seems lodged in the gregarious blunder also known as the south park mall. Where people are just bred differently. 


All in all I promise to visit this place each and EVERY time I return to Charlotte no matter what.

I haven't had a bad roll here, though the downside to that is that their menu seems to be a little too long. A couple of their burgers were a little greasy, but overall I've had good burgers here. 

If you are adventurous, make sure you try the burgersushi, they are very inventive & flavorful.

3073638,0,m67l1molr2bDueyLZAIo0g,QU7Kdm6nzlRcJZzjwVu4ng,"Cowfish is interesting.  It's good, but it's pricey.  

First off, the menu is HUGE.  I will say it may be the largest menu I have ever seen in my life, outside of some wine lists.  If you've ever seen the Gordon Ramsey show ""Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares"", well Gordon would have a heart attack at the amount of items on the menu.  It took us over 20 minutes to order and may have been close to 30.  Once you get over the size of the menu, the food is pretty good, and the service is very attentive.  

We ordered a burger and some sushi.  Burger first:  It was good - on par with the previous tenant of the space, Custom Counter.  Fries too.  There are other places in Charlotte that have better burgers, but it was not bad.  Sushi - Again, it was good, but not the best in Charlotte.  I still believe Nikko's has the best sushi in town.  However, Cowfish is just as expensive as Nikko's.  And the atmosphere at Nikko's is better. And the sushi was prepared a bit better.  So, for the same price and better quality, why should I not go to Nikko's?  Short answer - I don't know.  I'm not a Cowfish hater, it was just more expensive than I would have expected for the quality.  They allow you to order a custom roll - so whatever you want on it, they will make it.  I had an inside out roll with yellowtail and jalapenos.  It was good and I would get the same thing again, with extra jalapenos though!

In summary, good but expensive sushi, decent burger.    


Side note:  They have a bunch of different milkshakes at Cowfish, but their blender sounds like a dentist's drill, so I beg you to avoid that if you can.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2010-12-18,2,review,0

There is nothing out there in the Southeast that I know of that is coming even close to this place.  Being from Atlanta where the burger craze is in full swing, this place puts some of our burger spots to shame.  Did I mention the sushi is bad-ass?

I mean, even if you know of a place in Charlotte to get better sushi, or burgers, or milkshakes, or Burgushi (doesn't exist anywhere else, seriously), or tea, or cocktails, or good wine, you can't get them all under one roof like this place does!

Was only in Charlotte for a couple of days, and I had to come twice just because I would have felt bad if I came here any less..  The menu is huge!  It would take you at least a couple of years dining  casually at this place to even try half of the menu.

Burgers I had were great and cooked perfectly.  Sushi rolls, although expensive, were awesome.  Burgushi, was strange but good and I would try it again.  Milkshake was tasty.  Didn't have a chance to try the ""adult"" milkshakes that contained booze, but I'll have one next time.  Seaweed salad was one of the best I've ever had.

These guys are booked pretty solid for dinner, best bet is the bar if you can't get a table.  Less crowded for lunch, but not by much.

The fact that they make you wait 20-minutes for a table despite 10 empty tables within view. Or, maybe it's the super creative and appetizing menu descriptions that don't quite match the food you're brought. I dunno. It could be a little bit of all of that. But, moral of that story is, I always go in excited, with high hopes and leave slightly underwhelmed. 

On my most recent visit, I ordered the sashimi - nigiri combo. A decent deal at $23 it included 8-pieces of spicy tuna, 3-pieces of nigiri (tuna, salmon and yellow tail) and 6-pieces of sashimi (3 salmon, 3 tuna). It was good. Incredibly fresh fish! But, lacked some creativity or pizazz. Ted got the short rib burger. I had a taste and liked it -- it had something sweet in the mix, maybe figs or dried cherries? He wasn't super impressed. Fries were cold. 

All in all, I wish Cow Fish would find a way to kick it up a notch or two and impress more. It really could be the perfect combo for me and Ted -- I could live on sushi and he is a total sucker for a good burger.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2016-10-12,2,review,1

Btw- the bison burger here was hands down one of the tastiest burgers I've ever had- props to putting chipotle seasoning to good use!

If your a sushi lover and If you have ever been to EEZ fusion in Birkdale village(SAME OWNERS) and enjoyed it then you will love Cowfish. The sushi at Cowfish and EEZ is the best around. They have the freshest sashimi and the biggest and tastiest rolls. In addition to the sushi you have to try the crab rangoon dip. The dip may actually be better than eating a crab rangoon itself. They drizzle a special sauce over the fried wontons to start and you can eat the wontons plain the sauce is so good. There sushi bar is pretty cool as well. They have screens on the bar that you can play all kinds of games. 

I could really care less but the only drawbacks about the restaurant is that the bathrooms are extremely small. One bathroom is for only one person at a time. The parking is a bit limited as well. Unless your lucky and find a spot in front of the restaurant you will have to park in the garage. The garage is about a block away. They do have some good sake's.

3073693,1,wjJmHkExNTXyQGwmgc8TYA,o9cBSpD3Cu777zQTy1AMTw,"Cowfish is a great atmospheric concept. Significant bar, patio, and menu.

This place has transformed from a Charlotte Flavor-of-the-Month to a Southpark standard in just a few years. It remains a destination where everyone smiles because they are so happy to be sitting there, and has ridiculous wait times. Ridiculous. 

In case you are unfamiliar, we in Charlotte tend to lose our minds over new establishments. We get excited about each of the six ""Grand Openings"" these places have, and we flock to them salaciously for a few months before we either:

a) lose interest 
b) realize we don't like them, or 
c) realize we don't like the people we keep seeing there. 

Often, these establishments crawl off to die upon this occurrence. 

Due to the nature of such establishments in such locations in this town, I wondered when the luster would fade on Cowfish. It hasn't. People are still waiting an hour and a half to sit down at 5pm on a rainy Tuesday.

What is truly great about Cowfish: The menu. It is extensive and very well-designed, replete with fun names and several regional specific (""Pittsburgoo-shi Sandwich,"" ""Georgia Roll"") and local-themed (""Southpark Roll,"" ""Foreplay Roll"") items. 

This menu is pages and pages long, containing a variety of burgers, sushi, sandwiches and salads. The focus, as the name says, is on burgers and sushi, and for one page, they are combined as ""Burgushi."" Regardless of his legal status within the county limits, WWE personality Ric Flair is featured in the Burgushi with ""The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi...Roll"". 

Among the burgers, ""The Arnold Hamandegger"" is a mammoth construction with meat and more meat. A half-pound beef burger with cheese, ham, egg, bacon and onions on it. Took me a few days to finish. Came as advertised, was delectable and not good for you.

Bento Boxes are a great choice - you get sushi (choose between several rolls), a mini-burger, edamame, sweet potato fries and Thai cucumbers.  

If there's an issue I wish to discuss, it's this: Cowfish's specialty rolls are just so heavy. 

The sushi chef seems intent on overloading these. If it doesn't have a creamy sauce or cream cheese in it, it's fried to a degree or has something fried on it or in it. And five or six of them have jalapenos. Jalapenos?",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-03-19,3,review,2

We were just here this week with some out of town guests and the overall experience was wonderful.  

We tried.....

 the salad with ginger dressing--very tasty (ginger dressing a little more runny then I prefer but still good)

the Edamame appetizer---pretty hard to botch that...it was good and there was quite a bit

Seaweed Salad--looked like grass but my friend enjoyed every bite so that's all that matters

The burger with bacon--very good, cooked perfectly, lots of bacon flavor, excellent
The burger was served with sweet potato fries and those were on-point and I love that they give such a large portion!

Various Sushi rolls--Miss Moffit, a couple eel rolls, and a couple create-your-own rolls...all very good, fresh, etc.  Miss Moffit is a little small for the price so that is a little disappointing.  I mean for $15 you at least want to be able to tell you had dinner...not so much with little miss moffit.


They accidentally messed up one of our rolls but the manager took it off the bill and took off the appetizers and salads.  I thought that was awesome...great customer service!


The wine list is good and affordable and they had other drink specials as well.

The patio, the atmosphere, the service, the food....all combined make for a great local staple.  It is no wonder they are so popular.  It is a great place to take out of town guests as well.

Flavor: 3
Originality: 5
Presentation: 3

There a few restaurants that have sushi and burgers on the same menu. I can't think of any that combine the two to make a burgushi.  Quite innovative in the preparation. The rice is pressed with crabmeat to form the ""bun"" with the sushi elements the middle. Can't say it would be something I would crave but it is different in terms of texture and flavor. It would be something I would recommend people try at least once.

I also tried the Elvis burger. Fried bananas, bacon, and believe it or not peanut butter. If its good enough for the King right? The first thing that hits you when you bite into it is indeed the peanut butter. It is lathered in there serving like a congealed glue holding the sweetness of the banana and the crunchy saltiness of the bacon. And then you get to the familiar taste of beef. It is quite a combination of flavors but can be ""heavy"" in taste to some. Not something you would eat on a daily basis though or else you'd want to end up like the King.

On a side note. If you have kids, I would recommend against ordering the chicken nuggets. They seemed overly processed and had the taste beat out of them. Very bland considering tofu had more flavor than these. I guess kids might not mind.

Overall, an intriguing place worth trying once.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2012-09-07,2,review,1

""You got your sushi in my hamburger!""

The Cowfish is a brilliant restaurant concept that marries the red-hot gourmet burger trend with always popular sushi and other various Asian(ish) food styles.  The prices are a bit high and the service is pushy, but the food is creative and it tastes pretty good too.

You can get a bento box that features a half-roll of sushi, a burger slider, and generous helpings of a few sides.  Mine was $14 and came with sweet potato fries, edamame, and some sort of pickled cucumber and onion salad.  Our server tried to talk me into ordering two full-sized entrees instead of the bento box because it would be more food.  Well, duh.  Two adult sized entrees will be more food, but it will also be twice the price.  And I can't imagine who would remain hungry after polishing off one of these bento boxes.  They are substantial.

The sushi roll was well prepared and fresh.  The slider tasted okay but it wasn't anything special.  It came topped with jalapeno and a spicy sauce.

I also sampled one of the regular, non-sushi full-sized burgers.  It had bacon on it and tasted pretty good, though not particularly memorable.  Passable but not craveable.

Our server kept trying to get us to order extra sides and more expensive items.  I understand that this is part of the job and that a higher bill means more tip money, but gee whiz... this guy was overkill.  After a certain point you've just got to let it go and leave your diners in peace.

I really, really love this concept.  The execution was decent too, although I think the burgers could use a bit of refining.  The prices seem too high by about $2-3 per dish and the service borders on rude, but I would return if I were in the Charlotte area again.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2013-07-08,4,review,3

Atmosphere: It's a good sit down spot that attracts a sophisticated crowd without being stuffy.  On my second visit they had live music outside, the guy was pretty good and did well known covers.  If you're going in the evening make a reservation, wait times can be horrific, 1hr+. Weekends you might be able to walk in and dine. 

The food: The menu is MASSIVE.  I'm talking 11 point font, double-sided, 10 page menus.  If you're the type that likes to return to a place and sample from all over...well it's not happening here unless you bring friends and share.  Which brings me to the topic of this place being a fusion eatery.  Thankfully both the sushi and the burgers are good. I enjoy sushi and like to eat it frequently.  I am not however, someone who says sushi doesn't exist outside of *insert the name of a city in another part of the country*.  Throwing that out there in case someone says the sushi at Cowfish isn't ""real sushi.""  I haven't tried the ""Burgushi"" - it's Burger elements placed into sushi or the sandwiches with sushi elements placed into them, although I've heard good things.  The various rolls I have tried and the house burger (which you can customize the daylights out of) were both good.  I suggest the burger as a nice standby for friends that aren't quite ready to dive into sushi beyond a piece or two.  

All in all:  It's a great place for anyone who loves sushi or burgers or for someone who is trying to get their burger eating friends to try sushi.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2011-07-02,0,review,0

If so, then Cowfish is for you.

If not...we probably shouldn't hang out.

We showed up on a Saturday afternoon and there was about a 25 minute wait so I can only imagine what dinner sans reservation would be like. The servers were all super friendly, from the bartender who brought our drinks and stopped to shoot the shit about one of the brewery's that he had info on, to the waiter who scooted in with the ladies next to us when taking their orders ""so I don't have my butt all in anyone's face"". The atmosphere is funky and filled with great pop art, but not so swank that i felt out of place in errand attire.

But enough about the frills, you care about the food right? We got a small edamame, which was by no means small ($4), and split three 8-piece Makimono: the spicy tuna roll ($7), the volcanic roll ($13) and the dynamite roll($13). All the fish was very fresh and generously cut. I'm curious to try their burgushi, which is a fusion of land ingredients and sushi form, or sushi ingredients and burger form, depending on what you pick. There was more than enough food to keep us both full until late in the evening, so you get what you pay for, but the menu does get a but pricey if you aren't bargain-conscious (read: cheap).

Cowfish is by all means a great sushi place to go for an occasional lunch treat or a special event, but I'm thinking for normal sushi nights, I might stick a little closer to home (and budget).",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2011-01-30,2,review,1

Last time, I tried the bento box with sliders. You get a very tiny portion of high-quality ground beef, with lighter Japanese fare. I did not leave engorged, and it was the perfect amount of food.

My wife gets the 'build-your-own' sushi, which is very consistently good. 

I love the ambiance, which is very Not-Southern. My only 'beef' is that it's damn near impossible to get a table at peak dinner time. We come early (before 12n) on workdays to grab a table.

We finally decided to give it a shot, if for no other reason but to avoid the ""you should try Cowfish"" conversation in the future.  We called on a Thursday to book a reservation for a Friday dinner, but were disappointed to learn that the restaurant does not take reservations.  We went on a Friday, but my wife took too long getting ready and by the time we got there, the wait was two hours.  Carol gets grumpy when she is hungry, so it wasn't going to work.  We ended up going to Taco Mac and having a nice meal.

After the two failed attempts, we decided to go to Cowfish Tuesday at 2:00 pm. Third time was a charm! The boss gave me the go-ahead to leave the office early as long as I promised to try the surf-n-turf roll. 

When we walked in, we were immediately seated and provided with menus.  Day-drinking is the spark that keeps our marriage alive, so I ordered 2 cucumber mint-inis.  They were good, but not life-changing.  My wife commented on how small my cucumber was, so I ordered a China Blossom for my second drink.  We hadn't received silverware yet, so we ordered appetizers we could eat with our hands.  The edamame and fried pickles were delivered to our table too quickly, as if they had been sitting in the kitchen ready to go the entire time.  The fried pickles were decent, but the edamame shells were extremely difficult to chew.  

It was a chore to read through the entire menu. I broke my boss's promise.  As good as filet mignon smothered with wasabi sounds, I had been having nosebleeds all week and didn't want to ruin another shirt. Nothing on the menu looked good, but we figured that we may as well try and order something to hold us over until dinner. I went with the Arnold Hamandeggar burger, minus the cheese, eggs, ham, and bacon, and Carol ordered a slice of cheesecake.

Mid-way through the third cocktail, I needed to use the restroom.  The waiter directed me there, and his instructions were clear and accurate.  However, the country slang coming from the speakers in the bathroom was distracting and I returned to the table without washing my hands. Thankfully, the waiter had finally provided us with silverware, and our dinner had arrived as well. The burger was very under-cooked and did not have the toppings to compensate, so Carol and I shared the cheesecake.

I was so hungry I wanted to order some food just so my brain would function well enough to order the rest of the Meal (maybe a Burger)  

Near the top of the menu I saw the Onion Rings, noticing they were ""Thick Cut"" I was tempted to get them anyway because they had a ""Panko Coconut"" Batter (I did not order them this first time).  As hungry as I was I would almost say it was a miracle that I read enough of the Appetizers to see one called ""Sticks, Sweets and Strings"" so I interrogated my Great Waiter about this and he told me that I could skip the ""Sticks"" (which are plain Fries - Probably a great move - I would rather write 5 star reviews than any other).  Great suggestion!  These Sweet Potato Fries were the BEST I have eaten up to this point in my life!  The Onion Straws (super thin sliced and lightly battered onion rings) were the BEST Onion Straws/Rings I have had in a Restaurant! !! !!!

The Burger was Excellent!  I ordered it Medium Well (I think and I think the Chef was reading my mind though I did not meet the Chef until he brought my Burger to me).  Here is your flavor clue and it should be a BIG Clue: I intentionally ordered this Burger topped with only Red Onion, Pickles and a Bun in order to TASTE the Burger!  If a Burger is GREAT it should be able to ""stand on its own"" this one Stood well! !! !!  Incredible Flavor and PERFECTLY Cooked, an EASY 5 yelp stars!

Onion Straws (now my ""Onion Ring"" list won't be so lonely) an Easy 5 stars!

Sweet Potato Fries: Best I've eaten so far... 5 yelp stars!

Fried Pickles, hummm maybe 3 stars compared to the other food here.

Cowfish looks great and the service is excellent!  I did not pay attention to the prices until it was time to pay and I was expecting my bill to be more, so I checked it (everything was there)!  For the Volume and Quality this is a GREAT VALUE! !! !!!  That is why it is easy for me to say I will eat here again and soon!  If you are in the restroom and you want some restroom humor you will probably get some if you are in there long enough to wash your hands and you can ignore the signs, (well maybe pay attention until you get where you are going) though the signs are pretty cool too!

Where they need help:  The Desserts could be Much, MUCH more creative!  Cowfish has put so much Creative Geniusry in the first part of their menu, the choices for Desserts and Coffee make it easy to pass!  I bet most people need an excuse for Dessert (NOT me) though I'm not ordering Dessert just for another photo.  It has to be good and I expect something Totally Unique from a place that has used their imagination so well on the mains!

Minor Point: If you have never had Masala Chai you may enjoy this one.  What they served me was very good tasting Hot Spiced Tea and better than what most Indian restaurant call Masala Chai, yet what Cowfish calls Masala Chai is a far scream from what I have experienced as truly great Masala Chai.  Even so, what they served me had great flavor for hot tea.

Tiny point:  the BBQ sauce was good (I had Three small dishes of it), though I expected it to be as good as everything else!  This is a tiny point to me because this is not a BBQ joint, though I did put it on my: Sweet Potato Fries, Burger and Onion strings!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2012-03-21,2,review,1

Our drinks was emptied for a long time, and no one seemed to care. There was a man in a green shirt, maybe he's the manager or whatever he was, but he was walking around talking on his phone. That's just rude. If you're gonna talk on the phone, go somewhere else, don't come walking around everyone talking. He walked by us a couple of times and act as if he didn't see our empty cups.

She don't even come check on us or refill our drinks and, when she does come check on us, she asked us to leave? How RUDE?!

There are grilled chicken pieces, apples, fries and a cute little ""sushi"" dessert made from rice krispy treat and a swedish fish wrapped with a thin strip of fruit leather.  This came with a drink, too. I tasted his chicken and it was really good. My nigiri was ok. The sashimi was cut way too big. While some people may love getting huge pieces of sashimi, I don't. It's not nice to look at and even worse it's not great trying to eat it. My husband said his roll was ok - over sauced, but ok. Preparing sushi and sashimi is an art that few people master and accomplish so they can be called an itamae.

3073732,1,7M-rWYRGPfCDnb7tjl7QGQ,8StIXjmaHLeRLVXzOuThDA,"I know, I know.  Technically I'm not supposed to review a place where I have a ""relationship"" with the restaurant...but c'mon. It's not like I'm married to any emploee... I have a sushi roll named after me here. (The Neon Dion, seriously my favorite roll.)  I went through a period of time where I dined-in or got take out 3 times a week and know their stuff...so I MUST write a review!

Since there are SO many reviews here so I'll just put in my 2 cents and tips. 

Make reservations EARLY.  Yes, there can be a 1 to 2 hour wait...even for the bar.  But there's a reason why.  The food is fresh, eclectic, and WORKS.  The service is also spot on. If you have an issue with a menu item or if it's super busy and gets delivered to the wrong place, someone will find a solution for you, and do it graciously.  Marcus and Alan take great care in who they hire and keep a good staff.  

Do not be intimidated by the multitude of choices.  Ask your server what he/she recommends, and I promise you'll be steered in the right direction. 

SUSHI: The rolls are ENORMOUS.  (The prices can veer toward $20+ but you'll get what you pay for.) If you're cutting carbs, or just prefer a little less rice, order brown or ""Light Rice"".  I also suggest getting your roll cut into 10 pieces, so you can fit each piece in your mouth a little more comfortably. 

Bento Box is really the way to go to sample it all and get a FANTASTIC value.  A tiny slider of the day or classic slider, a smaller 4 piece version of a regular roll, or ""specialty"" shrimp tempura/Mark's (deep fried w/tuna + cream cheese) roll, edamame, sweet potato or regular fries, Thai cucumber salad (which is sweet, tangy and crisp) and 

The spiked shakes are creative and a fun alternative (Cold Cactus: ice cream, silver tequila, creme de menth, whipped cream, chocolate shavings? WOAH Nelly!) 

Check Facebook and their site for updates on specials like $5 martini nights and any special promotions.  

I could write a three-part series on the Cowfish, but instead, I say, JUST GO!  You won't regret it.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2011-08-14,6,review,1

Fast forward one month.  Sounds like a great place to go with the family after The Nutcracker. Yelp app = take me there, please of course.

Wow, this place is huge (and that was inside)! And just look at that fish tank! Pretty and classy! The patio is definitely the way to go - enclosed with heaters and the perfect mix of brisk and warm.

At first I was a little turned off by the size of the menu (Cheesecake Factory Encyclopedia Menu Flashback alert!) but it's broken into easily digested sections (hehe - pun intended).

Anyone that carries Wicked Weed Tyranny Red IPA is near and dear to my heart - this beer is beyond amazing. Really well chosen selection of beers!

Okay - hold the phone. Who thought it was a good idea to take a giant New York Barrel Style dill pickle, slice it thick and then deep fry it? Because I want to shake your hand - pure genius - BEST fried pickle I've had in Charlotte yet!!!

The Boursin Bacon Burger was more than one human can eat - the toppings themselves, Boursin Cheese, bacon, sautéed mushrooms and grilled onions were a meal!!!

The Bento box with your choice of mini burger and sushi is bound to be a winner. Why? Because you choose what comes in it!!! The edamame are a delicious and addictive side!! Get them!!

Don't get me started on the kid Bentos! Okay, you did! Ninja Nuggets! Real pieces of chicken not processed crap! And if you don't go gaga for the kid sushi dessert (Rice Krispy treat with Swedish fish) and say ""aw it's so freakin' cute"" then you probably don't think puppies and kittens are cute either.

3073947,2,EcuFr4jzjfnCdDst6-lf_A,IKUQMtM3_670rHG3DByvtA,"After hearing multiple raves from reliable sources about The Cowfish Sushi l Burger Bar, it was tops on the list to review. Having been twice, and both times with small kids, I've been impressed with different aspects of the SouthPark eatery. But seriously, the best part? Both visits have included Ric Flair spottings. WOO! NATURE BOY!

When I first heard of Cowfish, I was expecting more of a Sushi Samba vibe, but I was happily surprised by friendly rather than pretentious servers, water served on tables in glass milk bottles, and a tongue-in-cheek mood provided by the piped in Japanese-to-English translations of American colloquialisms in the restrooms, and the more obvious comic bookish canvases of fast food icons discussing burgers hanging beside Warholesque representations of sushi. There's a sense of humor here, and it is served up with a side of contemporary, innovative fun.

The place is bigger than it looks at first glance, and the menu is a tad overwhelming. On the first visit, I errantly chose the The Tuscan Turkey Burger. It was average, though the server mentioned it would be a little drier than a regular burger, which should have tipped me off to choose another option. On the second visit, I chose The Cowfish Bento Box with a slider and veggie sushi, and I realized why so many friends swear by Cowfish. There was more than enough food, and loads of different flavors that easily satisfied. Sushi is as well-presented as it is delicious, and the kid's meals include a happy face on the rice detail.

During the first visit, the service was exceptional. During the second visit, the service was good, especially considering it was Father's Day lunch, when they were busier than usual. Outdoor seating feels oddly cozy, especially since it overlooks highly trafficked Sharon Road, and umbrellas and fans make warm weather pleasant.

So, will I return to The Cowfish Sushi and Burger Bar? Does The Nature Boy say ""WOO""? I'll be taking my coupons I get by signing up on their website, and making a reservation, though.

I was a bit hesitant only because I'm an adventurous eater and love sushi, however, my daughter is a no-fish, no-spicy, no weird combo kind of girl. Cowfish fit us both. We both got the Bento Box. She had the shrimp tempura roll and a regular mini slider in hers. I had the Firecracker roll and the speciality jalapeño cheese double burger in mine. She loved her meal, though she said the cucumber salad was too spicy for her. I loved everything about my meal. The sushi was excellent. I thought the 4 pieces would be small but they were huge, to the point I had to cut them in half. The burger was a good sized and perfectly cooked slider. I like spicy so I liked the salad. And the edamame was plentiful. Also, I got regular French fries and even though I'm not a fan of fries, these were good enough for me to bring home the leftovers.

I also ordered the ahi tuna ""nachos."" Don't let the word nacho fool you. It's more of a crispy cracker with their (incredible) crab Rangoon dip, avocado, and beautifully seasoned pieces of fresh tuna. It was excellent, fresh, and refreshing. 

We were pretty full so we did some shopping. But before we left we headed back to try their milkshakes. Any place that has marshmallow in a shake has my business. I ordered the Smores and my daughter got the Cake Shake with chocolate cake. Hers was sweeter, like cake and ice cream in a single sip. I could even taste the frosting from the cake. The Smores shake was rich in marshmallow and graham cracker flavoring though neither overpowered the other. Towards the end, I got a lot of chocolate syrup so they could tone it down just a bit on that. We got our shakes to go but that didn't stop them from being presented very nicely. They were, to put it simply, pretty shakes. Pretty darn yummy ones that is!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2016-05-21,1,review,0

Been here twice after so many people mentioned it-- Was a great time from the ambiance (modern /hip feel) to the meal and drinks. Burgishi (sp?) roll was awesome. I was hesitant about the combo of burger and sushi, but actually the way they combine with the sauces and baking turned out perfect in taste! 

 Half off sake on thursdays and I'd recommend the 'pearl' sake; The apple sake was way too sweet for my likings.. The key lime drink was pretty fantastic. The pricing is what would be expected for a place such as this..can add up but was worth it. 
A great/long bar area too but not much place to stand around it or linger. 

The tuna appetizer was fantastic. The 'fries' appetizer was just too much and not that great but everything else on target. The different salads have been lovely, full of flavor too.

Oh, let me add (to address another reviewers comments), that cowfish definently isn't the typical authentic sushi place, so dont come expecting that; It is spin off of the typical items, likely unhealthy for some rolls, but definently delish!

Brief background - this is a sushi restaurant + burger spot + bar, all of which on their own would probably be good. Nestled in a larger shopping complex, this spot is remarkably big, with indoor and outdoor seating available. The menu is overwhelming, so do some research or, if you're like me, opt for the bento box. 

As noted, I opted for the bento box which gives you a combination of burger elements, salad, sushi roll etc. Its a bit much as I've never had sushi and burgers within the same meal, so be prepared. I'd strongly recommend 'The Boss' though, so check it out. 

My only issue with this place is the menu - its really large and quite overwhelming as everything sounds great. That being said, I also say its an opportunity to come back here and try many more items. Also, not sure how sustainable such a large menu is, especially if you want to be ""great"" at either sushi or burgers, so I'll keep that in mind as I try other places on my business trips. 

Also, I recommend calling ahead or somehow finding a way to get a table during dinner hour, as I've been told its fairly difficult.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2016-01-02,1,review,1

I would highly recommend putting in a reservation so that you can get a table and not wait as long. Whether you reserve or test your luck, it will be worth it either way.

Cowfish is a combination sushi bar and burger joint, but our party only had burgers so that's all I can vouch for. The burgers were a bit steep in price (ranging from $10-$15) but totally worth the price. You won't find a normal bacon cheeseburger here, and all the burgers are made of the best quality meat and toppings, and most of the burger options are a bit different, and HUGE!!! I ordered the C.B.C.L.T. ($10) which was a burger with sharp cheddar, white cheddar, and bacon on a brioche bun. I substituted the beef burger for the bison burger (extra $4) because I prefer bison to beef for the leaner meat and superior taste. It was a gigantic burger that took up a good chunk of my plate. Filling out the rest of the plate was a heaping order of sweet potato fries. There were so many that my wife, mother-in-law and myself were unable to finish even half the order. I'm not big on drinking alcohol with lunch, so I stuck with the mango iced tea which was a very tasty ""unsweetened"" iced tea, and I would recommend it if you're into unsweet tea.

My wife went with the fresh basil pesto turkey burger ($11) which pretty much speaks for itself. It was a good turkey burger with some nice spice to it, and the pesto tasted pretty darn fresh. She got the fried pickles as a side and absolutely loved them. My mother-in-law had the seared ahi tuna burger ($11) which was pretty good, aside from the fact that she ordered the tuna cooked MEDIUM (I gave her a stern lecture later on about that fiasco). That was served on a whole wheat bun with veggies and slaw with a ginger dressing. 

The burgers here are very delicious. Our bill came out to $44 in the end, which may seem a bit much for lunch for three, but it's totally worth the price. You can really taste the freshness in the burgers and the portions are insane!

I have been dining at this restaurant at least once a year since it opened, and every year it seems to change just slightly. When I say change, I mean that people from the queen city more and more come to realize that this place is as close to a foodie fusion place as it'd ever get in Charlotte. 
The very first time I came here was back in 2009, that was when they used a school bus to deliver orders. I thought it was a super cool concept, I had even read about it in the local magazine. At times I would show up at this restaurant and the manager would have daily huddles with his team of servers right before the restaurant open. I'd say great business mindset. Service is everything and they seem to have had it right. The interior decor is very matching of the name, everything had some kind of cow and some kind of fish resemblance. Aferall cow fish means a burger and sushi place!
The bar is a nice area with a cool blue back drop. The presentation of the food was nice, their burgers are stellar. Price is around the $10-$20 range for an average dish. 
The last time I was at this restaurant, It was late December 2014, by then it seems it had became the ""IT"" place of Charlotte. The wait was now around 1-1.5 hr just for dinner on a weekend. They ask for your number and you can track the status of your wait on a cute website with a fish.

Don't forget to ask for 10 pieces instead of 8. Last time i nearly choked and seriously burgushied all over the table when i started laughing right after shoving the huge roll in my mouth.

The appetizers we've had have all been good. My favorite was the potstickers which i don't see on their online menu at the moment? The crab rangoon dip was also good and the Sweets, Sticks and Strings seem like a steal for $5 to split. 

Sidenote: We also really liked the wanton soup that was not available today unfortunately.

We ordered the truffle fries, nachos, and fried pickles as our appetizers. The truffle fries were delish, but I mean you can never really go wrong with truffle. The fried pickles were pretty good and the nachos were semi decent because of the avocado. I ordered the fusion box because I couldn't choose between a burger and sushi. I was definitely satisfied with my choice. The specialty roll that came with the box was very good-little spicy and very flavorful. The mini burger wasn't bad but not the best I've ever had. I usually dont like sweet potato fries but they were very crispy and good. I also ordered a spiked shake ( the no sleep til brooklyn) and it was a nice tasty way to cool off! 

As far as service goes, I was very impressed with our waiter. We were in a large group and he brought all of us separate checks which is pretty unusual in New York City so I was appreciative of that. 

My only warning would be to NOT sit outside on a very hot day (which is every night during the summer in good ole charlotte). Everyone basically ended up packing their food because it was way too hot to eat anything.

If you go on a Fri or Sat evening, you better have a reservation or be prepared to wait for two hours.

I called early on Sat around lunch requesting a reservation that evening. I was told they had reached their reservation capacity. The story is they only allow about two thirds of the inside and outside tables for reservations so they can accomodate walk-ins. While that may be true it still feels like they make you wait so you can stimulate their bar business.
They were successful with our party of five.

We got there at 830p and were seated at 1030p. By that time, half the restaurant was empty.

The inside tables were closing down so they seated us on the patio. It was only about 85 degrees. 

They did have a guy singing and playing which was cool, mostly covers and we were all impressed that he would attempt...'Don't Stop Belivin' by Journey.

We all had Sushi...it was good...not stellar or exceptional but good. I had the Chef's Nirvana platter, mosty everyone else had the LaVa platter.

It was fresh and tasty and out server was spot on all night...thanks Jeff
for a great night...on your last night there.. 

They had a few draft beers of which the Founders IPA was good. They also have Bells Two Hearted Ale in the bottle.

Out of all of the places in Charlotte, this is the one that stuck out to me as something I needed to see.  Being from LA, we have a much larger selection of places to eat and I just thought this was niche for Charlotte.

I have to say that overall I was disappointed.  Sigh.  I was hoping for so much more.  

I went there on a Sunday night.  I was worried about it being busy, so that's why I choose Sunday.  The location is chill, right in the middle of upper class shops.  Parking was a bit of a pain - but we found a spot in the lot.

The service was...well....not really there.  The menu is huge.  WAY too huge.  Why offer people so much?  Just doesn't make sense to me.  It took over 20 minutes to make a decision and I'm telling you I still didn't make it all the way through the menu.  The waitress kept telling us the ""top picks"" - well then why not just have the ""top picks"" as your menu?  It was so overwhelming and confusing.

Also part of the food selection process is the overwhelming amount of ingredients.  Like how many things can you shove together that possibly haven't been shoved together in another meal.  I found this hard - too much information to digest.  Figuring out which taste pallet to go for was too difficult.

So I stuck to the burger.  And what I thought would be simple - the black Truffle burger.  Now....I know my truffles.  KNOW them.  Intimately.  But this burger fell short.  It was suppose to be a truffle explosion in my mouth - the menu promised:  beef burger topped with black truffle cheese, roasted shallots and truffle-infused sautéed mushrooms. Served on brioche with leaf lettuce and roasted garlic aioli.

What I tasted when I ate the burger:  An overcooked burger in grease with mushrooms and maybe some truffle oil drizzled on top then a soggy bun.  The brioche would have been good but since it was soggy it didn't taste right.

The fries were way too much for a serving.

The waitress did her best to try to pump us full with drinks - must have come by every two seconds trying to get us to try another drink - but once the food arrived and she realized we weren't drunks, she never came back to ask how the food was.  So very disappointed on that note.

Once they realized we weren't there to drink I feel like the service really dropped and they just wanted us to move along.  Shame.

So overall it was not the experience I was looking for in Charlotte.  Next time I am in town I will try another Yelp selection.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,2,2013-06-20,3,review,1

After having almost a week to let my thoughts process, I would have to say that although the product is fresh, I wouldn't consider Cowfish a true sushi spot but an Americanized version.  I also think overall Cowfish is lost in its trendiness.

The first time we attempted to go was on a Saturday night and showed up to an hour and a half wait.  Cowfish doesn't take reservations so we decided not to wait it out.  We later showed up on a Weds night and there was still an hour wait.  We eventually managed to grab 2 seats at the bar and just made it a night there.

The items we ordered were Blackened tuna nachos, Southpark roll, and the King's Roll.  I have to say I really liked the tuna nachos, but they aren't sushi.  The King's Roll was the better of the two rolls.  I asked if they had miso soup, and sadly, they did not.  The wasabi was also the squeeze kind that is never hot enough.

The part I didn't like was it felt much more of a bar scene than a restaurant.  When I went to Nikko, I didn't downgrade them for the club atmosphere, because it really didn't interfere with the meal.  Definitely not the case here.  People were everywhere, especially hanging over me while I ate.

3074007,0,sdLns7062kz3Ur_b8wgeYw,QdNmknXpxkj3hd_OJMxaFw,"I have mixed feelings about Cowfish. I've been here on several occasions and this was the lesser of my visits. To start, I had an 8:15 reservation, but had to wait another 20 minutes to be seated. This was fine, as other guest hadn't arrived, so it worked out in the end. My waitress was extremely nice about waiting until other guest arrived before being ready to order a main course.

I started off with the Jim Bean milkshake and the crab rangoon dip. The milkshake is GREAT!!!! They do not skimp on the alcohol. There was also a large stick pretzel that there for decorative purposes, but complimented the sweet milkshake nicely. The crab dip was okay. There was a sufficient amount of lump crab meat in the dip. However, the cream cheese(?) and cheese overpowered the crab, rendering the meat as a mere texturizer, but lacking in impactful taste. The chips that came with the dip were not too crispy and airy enough to be eaten with little effort. There was a red sauce on the chips that was sweet that I could have done without. Honestly, I would skip the crab dip and opt for the egg rolls, which are always a hit.

For the entree, I ordered a custom lobster roll with cream cheese, cucumber, and avocado topped with eel sauce and tobiko. There were pieces of shell in my first couple bites of sushi, which made me super cautious about the remainder and unable to just eat without worry. It's great they're using fresh lobster, but because of this, I would caution you to stay away from lobster here. Additionally, the avocado and cream cheese used were too thick for sushi, making the bites large. And there were a few pieces of onion that I tasted. In the future, I'll stick with one of the sushi/burgushi options on the menu.

My guest ordered the Taste Explosion roll, which he liked. I've had it before and I recommend it, especially if you don't normally eat sushi and want to be adventurous.

Because this experience was uniquely not great, I'm going to rate them at 3 stars, despite this outing being more like 2. I'll probably revisit in the next month or so and see how it goes.

I finally called Cowfish to get a better bead on their location, and found them (eventually). The place was packed on my arrival, but they have quite a large horseshoe bar, and I was able to find a seat on the end. 

The former Yelp CLT CM used to post Cowfish food porn pics, and they always looked awesome. And when I heard Cowfish was coming soon to Raleigh, I wanted to get a scoop on what to expect...

The idea of burger-sushi fusion is intriguing... but after my long drive, and looking over the burg-ushi, etc. options, I decided I wasn't feeling up to ordering something I might not enjoy. They have quite a long list of burgers and sushi rolls, which makes this restaurant concept kind of cool, because it's a place that will please anyone; it actually occurred to me I could take my non-sushi-eating parents there if I ever had a raw craving. I started with nigiri (white fish and yellowtail) and sake. Then followed that up with the Chef roll, which was large and tasty. All rolls can be made with brown rice for an extra fee.

Despite being busy, service was fast and attentive. The bar area has touch games built into the surface, which is neat-o. My biggest problem was the sticker shock. My drink, two pieces of nigiri, roll, and tip ran me ~$40, which is a lot to spend considering there's equally high-quality fish available for less where I live.

-- Blackened Lobster Roll:  very interesting concept, having lobster crab cake in a sushi roll.  First couple pieces were good, but I got a little tired of it after a while.  I'd go for something closer to legit sushi next time to even out the flavor.  

-- Boursin Burger:  the boursin cheese was awesome, and the burger was pretty good, but it was a little dry for my flavor.

-- Sides:  Soured cucumbers were good, but there was a little too much of it.  Sweet potato fries were good, but a little mushy.  And edamame was delicious, there's really no way to mess up edamame anyway.

-- Environment:  Is great, the decor around this place was very nice.  I loved their canvas'.  And their fish tank is amazing.  They actually have a longhorn cowfish in their tank!

Nevertheless, my first impression of this burger-meets-sushi-and-more place was positive. Service was prompt and attentive despite her responsibility for several other large tables, and the atmosphere is lively and casual-hip, if not a little loud (but again, it was a weekend night).

We loved the blackened ahi tuna nacho appetizer, and my entree--eight Miss Moffitt's rolls--was enough to have me leaving full and happy. More words of advice with regard to the latter: not for the dainty eater. These are gargantuan rolls, and unless you go fork-and-knife you're going to have to be comfortable with no-shame facial contortion and chubby cheeks.

One of my dining companions loved his C.B.C.L.T. burger, and I was eyeing the Green Monster before opting for sushi--perhaps worth a try another time when I'm in the mood for a patty.  Oh, and the menu is a novelette, so you'll probably need a little time with it as a newbie diner.

I'm very sensitive so it is always a gamble when trying a new restaurant for the first time but the waitress was well trained and knew exactly what I was talking about. They don't have a separate gluten free menu but all the GF items are clearly marked.  They also brought out gluten free soy sauce for me (always a bonus). 

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the prices.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2014-09-05,0,review,0

The sushi is FRESH & DELICIOUS!
The decor and atmosphere is unique!

Only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is purely based on the lack of seating when you are waiting, the constant wait, long wait times at dinner, and sometimes the servers are spread a little too thin to be as helpful or attentive as preferred!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2013-01-01,3,review,2

The bartender was one of the best, very friendly and attentive.  Crab rangoon to start was creamy and perfect with the fried wontons.  Burger sushi, miso soup, ginger creme brûlée is a must.  Owner came over to chat us up.  Hip atmosphere, huge menu, and huge bar.  Definitely go here!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2012-04-21,1,review,1

I suggest deciding on a few entrees that can be shared between everyone to sample some of the variety of dishes they offer. Also, if you are a big eater I would recommended an appetizer to supplement your entree. I left wanting a bit more, but still satisfied. I highly recommend the blackened tuna roll, its the perfect blend of flavors in nicely presented roll. Definitely worth a try if you are into sushi or burgers or both!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2012-05-13,0,review,1

How can you when the burgers are that good and the service is just fantastic! Thank you Cowfish!!,RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,5,2012-04-04,0,review,0

The first time I made my own sushi, which was alright, because I really know nothing about making my own sushi. The next time I had the bento box with California Roll, which was really good. The sides of thai cucumbers and sweet potato fries were delicious, as was the mini burger. My boyfriend had the Jalapeno Popper Show-Stopper, which he enjoyed a lot. The next time we were there he ordered The Nature Boy's WOOOOO-shi BuffalOOOOO-shi Roll, which has bison meat in it and he loved that too. I had the Heavenly Veggie burger which was delicious.
So all-in-all, I love this place and think it's a great place to have in the Queen City.

Although if you are going here on weekends, make sure to call ahead since they have long waits.",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2013-01-30,1,review,0

We stopped by for lunch while in town and I was so happy we did!
First of all, the concept was brilliant. I am a appetizer type eater. I like a little of this, a little of that... and sushi can always fit in for me. 
My burger of the week was delicious, with a spicy sauce on it and perfectly cooked. Also, perfectly appetizer sized and adorable.
The sushi roll was flavorful and fresh...
the presentation was awesome! I would definitely come back here to try the other meat-sushi combos! It was protein heaven! ""Burgushi"" is now something I wish every city had!",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,4,2011-08-14,0,review,0

To be fair- I have only been here once. I don't feel comfortable giving them 4 stars (and I save my 5 stars for 5 star moments). I felt like it was lackluster. Perhaps I heard too much hype? Perhaps I just don't ""get"" the burger/sushi concept?",RAh9WCQAuocM7hYM5_6tnw,3,2014-02-19,0,review,0
